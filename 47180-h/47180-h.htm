<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">One</span> of the most remarkable chapters in the astronomy of the
past century was commenced on the very first night with
which that century began. It was, indeed, on the 1st of January,
1801, that the discovery of a new planet was announced. The five
great orbs&mdash;Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury, Mars, and Venus&mdash;had been
known from the earliest times of which we have records, and the
planet Uranus had been discovered nearly twenty years before the
previous century closed. The solar system was thus thought to
consist of these six planets and, of course, the earth. On the
memorable night to which I have referred, Piazzi, the astronomer,
made a remarkable advance. He discovered yet another planet&mdash;the
seventh, or eighth, if the earth be included. The new body
was a small object in comparison with those which were previously
known. It was invisible to the unaided eye, and seemed no more
than a starlike point even when viewed through a telescope. It
revolved around the sun in the wide region between the orbits of
Mars and Jupiter. This discovery was speedily followed by others
of the same kind, and, as the century has advanced to its close, the
numbers of these planets&mdash;asteroids, as they are generally called&mdash;has
been gradually increasing, so much so that now, of these little
bodies known to astronomers, the number amounts to about four
hundred and fifty.</p>

<p>But just as the beginning of the century was heralded by the
discovery of the first of these asteroids, so the close of the century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
will be signalized in the history of astronomy by the detection
among these little objects of one which has entirely cast into the
shade all other discoveries of the same nature. On the night of the
13th of August, 1898, a German astronomer, Herr Witt, exposed a
photographic plate to the heavens in his telescope in the Observatory
of Urania, at Berlin. On that plate a picture of the heavens
was obtained, and in that picture a new planet was revealed. At
first the discovery of one more asteroid does not imply very much.
Hundreds of such planets might be found, and indeed have been
found, and yet no particular comment has been called forth. But
this planet found by Witt is a unique object; it is more interesting
than the whole of the four hundred and thirty-two other minor
planets which have preceded it&mdash;not, indeed, on account of its size,
for Witt’s planet is a wholly insignificant object from this point
of view. The special interest which this new planet has for us
dwellers on the earth lies in the fact that it seems to be the nearest
to the earth of all the other worlds in space&mdash;the moon, of course,
excepted. This is the reason why the attention of all who are interested
in the science of astronomy has been concentrated on
Witt’s discovery. It is certainly the most interesting telescopic
revelation which has been made for many years.</p>

<p>It may illustrate a characteristic feature in the progress of
modern astronomy if I describe how Witt succeeded in obtaining
this picture. He had selected one of the most rapid plates that
the skilled manufacturer can supply to the photographer. He put
this plate into his telescope, and he directed it to the heavens. If
that plate had been used in broad daylight for the more ordinary
purpose of obtaining a photographic portrait, an exposure of half
a second would have been quite long enough. But the very faint
stars can not work their charm on the plate with equal rapidity; a
second is not long enough, nor is ten seconds, nor even ten minutes.
If we desire to secure an imprint of the faintest stars we must
expose the plate for an hour, and sometimes for even much longer
than an hour. Of course, an exposure of such duration would
utterly ruin the picture if a gleam of any other light obtained
access. But in the darkness of night the plate is secure from this
danger. Each star is thus given time enough to impress its little
image at leisure.</p>

<p>The photographer has often occasion to deplore the poorness
of his light. It is, of course, in the endeavor to counteract the
poorness of the light that so long an exposure is frequently given.
But it will not be any longer supposed that, from the astronomer’s
point of view, a tedious exposure must necessarily be a disadvantage.
Let it be henceforth recollected that it was the very requirement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
of a long exposure which led to the present important discovery.
If the stars had been bright enough to be photographed
by an exposure not longer than a few seconds or even than a few
minutes, then this new and wonderful planet Eros would not have
been revealed.</p>

<p>Many points of light which were undoubtedly stars, and merely
stars, were shown on this picture taken by the German astronomer
at Urania. Among these points of light was, however, one object
which, though in appearance hardly distinguishable from a faint
star, was in truth a body of a very different character. No telescope,
however powerful, would show by mere inspection any appreciable
difference between the dot of light indicating a star and
the dot of light indicating the asteroid Eros. The fundamental
difference between the star and Eros was, however, revealed by
the long exposure. The stars in such a picture are, of course, at
rest. They have occupied for years and for centuries the places
where we now find them. If they are moving at all, their movements
are so slow that they need not now be considered. But this
starlike point, or, as we may at once call it, this asteroid, Eros,
is moving. Not that its movements seem very rapid from the distance
at which alone we are compelled to view it. No casual glance
would indicate that Eros was flying along. The ordinary observer
would see no change in its place in a second&mdash;no change in
its place even in a minute. But when the exposure has lasted for
an hour this asteroid, in the course of the hour, has moved quite
appreciably. Hence arose a great difference between the representation
which the photograph has given of the stars, properly
so called, and of the asteroid. Each star is depicted as a sharp,
well-defined point. This little body which is not a star, this unsteady
sitter in the picture, could not be so represented; it merely
appeared as a streak. The completed photograph accordingly
shows a large number of well-marked dots for the stars, and among
them one faint line for the asteroid.</p>

<p>Such a feature on a picture, though very unusual, does sometimes
present itself. To detect such a streak on a photograph of
the stars is a moment of transcendent joy to the astronomer. It
is often for him the exciting occasion on which a discovery is made.
This little moving point is in actual fact as different from a star as
a pebble is different from a brilliant electric light. The resemblance
of the asteroid to a star is merely casual; the resemblance
would wholly disappear if we were able to make a closer inspection.
The star is a brilliant blazing orb like a sun, but so far away
that its luster is diminished to that of a point; the planet is comparatively
near us; it is a dark body like our earth, and is like our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
earth also in this further respect that all the light it enjoys has
been derived from the sun.</p>

<p>Though there is this immense difference between a star and a
planet, yet the observer must not expect to notice any such difference
by merely taking a peep through the telescope. It was only
the long exposure in the photograph that revealed the little body.</p>

<p>Such is the manner in which an asteroid is generally discovered
in these latter days. A discovery like this comes as the well-earned
reward of the skill and patience of the astronomical photographer.
There are, indeed, a large number of known asteroids; our catalogues
contained four hundred and thirty-two of them up to the
time when Witt exposed his now famous plate. Had the asteroid
Witt then found been merely as other asteroids, it would never have
received the prominent position that has now to be assigned to it in
any account of the astronomy of the century. That object found
by Witt on this night which is to be henceforth memorable in astronomy
is of a wholly exceptional kind. Had Eros been merely an ordinary
asteroid, Witt might no doubt have received the credit to
which his labors and success would have entitled him. Another asteroid
would have been added to the long list of such objects already
known, but the newspapers would never have troubled their readers
about the matter, and the only persons who would have been
affected would have been the astronomers, and perhaps even among
them no particular sympathy would have been felt in certain quarters.
Those particular astronomers to whom has been intrusted
the special work of looking after the asteroids and of calculating
the tables of their movements might even have received with no
very great enthusiasm the announcement of this further addition to
the burden on their heavily laden shoulders.</p>

<p>I have said that Eros is quite a small globe; it may be well for
us fully to realize how small that asteroid actually is. If the moon
were to be crushed into two million equal fragments, each of those
parts would be as big as Eros. If the whole of Eros were to be
covered with houses, the city thus formed would not be so large
as greater London. So far as mere size is concerned, Eros is quite
unimportant. We can further illustrate this if we compare Eros
with some of the other planets. The well-known evening star,
Venus, the goddess of love, is a hundred million times as big as
that tiny orb we now call Eros, the god of love. After all this
it may seem strange to have to maintain what is, however, undoubtedly
the fact, that the discovery of Eros is one of the most remarkable
discoveries of this century.</p>

<p>Until Eros was discovered, our nearest neighbors among the
planets were considered to be Venus on one side and Mars on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
other. The other great planets are much more distant, while, of
course, the stars properly so called are millions of times as far.</p>

<p>Great, then, was the astonishment of the astronomers when,
by the discovery of Eros, Mars and Venus were suddenly dethroned
from their position of being the earth’s nearest neighbors among
the planetary host. This little Eros will, under favorable circumstances,
approach the earth to within about one third the distance
of Mars when nearest, or about one half the distance of Venus
when nearest. We thus concentrate on Eros all the interest which
arises from the fact that, the moon of course excepted, Eros is the
nearest globe to the earth in the wide expanse of heaven. To the
astronomer this statement is of the utmost significance; when Eros
comes so close it will be possible to determine its distance with a
precision hitherto unattainable in such measurements. Once the
distance of Eros is known, the distance of the sun and of all the
other planets can be determined. The importance of the new discovery
arises, then, from the fact that by the help of Eros all our
measurements in the celestial spaces will gain that for which every
astronomer strives&mdash;namely, increased accuracy.</p>

<p>Seeing that the existence of intelligence is a characteristic feature
of this earth, we feel naturally very much interested in the
question as to whether there can be intelligent beings dwelling on
other worlds around us. It is only regrettable that our means
of solving this problem are so inadequate. Indeed, until quite
lately it would have been almost futile to discuss this question at
all. All that could then have been said on the subject amounted
to little more than the statement that it would be intolerable presumption
for man to suppose that he alone, of all beings in the universe,
was endowed with intelligence, and that his insignificant
little earth, alone amid the myriad globes of space, enjoyed the distinction
of being the abode of life. Recent discovery has, however,
given a new aspect to this question. At the end of this century
certain observations have been made disclosing features in the
neighboring planet, Mars, which have riveted the attention of the
world. On this question, above most others, extreme caution is
necessary. It is especially the duty of the man of science to weigh
carefully the evidence offered to him on a subject so important.
He will test that evidence by every means in his power, and if he
finds the evidence establishes certain conclusions, then he is bound
to accept such conclusions irrespective of all other circumstances.</p>

<p>Mr. Percival Lowell has an observatory in an eminently favorable
position at Flagstaff, in Arizona. He has a superb telescope,
and enjoys a perfect climate for astronomical work. Aided by
skillful assistants, he has observed Mars under the most favorable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
circumstances with great care for some years. I must be permitted
to say that, having carefully studied what Mr. Lowell has
set forth, and having tested his facts and figures in every way in
my power, most astronomers have come to the conclusion that,
however astonishing his observations may seem to be, we can not
refuse to accept them.</p>

<p>No one has ever seen inhabitants on Mars, but Mr. Percival
Lowell and one or two other equally favored observers have seen
features on that planet which, so far as our experience goes, can be
explained in no other way than by supposing that they were made
by an intelligent designer for an intelligent purpose. Mr. Lowell
has discovered that there are certain operations in progress on the
surface of Mars which, if we met with on this earth, we should certainly
conclude, without the slightest hesitation, were the result of
operations conducted under what we consider rational guidance.</p>

<p>A river, as Nature has made it, wends its way to and fro; it
never takes the shortest route from one point to another; the width
of the river is incessantly changing; sometimes it expands into a
lake, sometimes it divides so as to inclose an island. If we could
discern through our telescopes a winding line such as I have described
on Mars it might perhaps represent a river.</p>

<p>But suppose, instead of a winding line, there was a perfectly
straight line, or rather a great circle on the globe drawn as straight
as a surveyor could lay it out&mdash;if we beheld an object like that
on Mars I think we should certainly infer that it was not a river
made in the ordinary course of natural operations; no natural
river ever runs in that regular fashion. If such a straight line
were indeed a river, then it must have been designedly straightened
by human agency or by some other intelligent agency for
some particular purpose. In its larger features Nature does not
work by straight lines. A long and perfectly straight object, if
found on our earth, might be a canal or it might be a road; it
might be a railway or a terrace of some kind; but assuredly no
one would expect it to be a natural object.</p>

<p>We have the testimony of Schiaparelli, now strengthened by
that of Mr. Lowell and his assistants, that there are many straight
lines of this kind on Mars. They appear to be just as straight as
a railway would have to be if laid across the flat and boundless
prairie, where the engineer encountered no obstacle whatever to
make him swerve from the direct path. These lines on Mars run
for hundreds of miles, sometimes, indeed, I should say for thousands
of miles. They are far wider than any terrestrial river, except
perhaps the Amazon for a short part of its course. The lines on
Mars are about forty miles wide. Indeed, the planet is so distant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
that if these lines were much narrower than forty miles they would
be invisible. Each of them is marvelous in its uniformity throughout
its entire length.</p>

<p>The existence of these straight lines on the planet contains perhaps
the first suggestion of the presence of some intelligent beings
on Mars. The mere occurrence of a number of perfectly straight,
uniform lines on such a globe would in itself be a sufficiently remarkable
circumstance. But there are other features exhibited
by these objects which also suggest the astonishing surmise that
they have been constructed by some intelligent beings for some
intelligent purposes.</p>

<p>Sometimes two of these lines will start from a certain junction,
sometimes there will be a third or a fourth from the same junction;
in one case there are as many as seven radiating from the same
point. Such an arrangement of these straight lines is certainly
unlike anything that we find in Nature. We are led to seek for
some other explanation of the phenomenon, and here is the explanation
which Mr. Lowell offers:</p>

<p>It has recently been found that there are no oceans of water
on the planet Mars. In earlier days it used no doubt to be believed
that the dark marks easily seen in the telescope could represent
nothing but oceans, but I think we must now give up the
notion that these are watery expanses. Indeed, there is not much
water on that globe anywhere in comparison with the abundance
of water on our earth. It is the scarcity of water which seems to
give a clew to some of the mysteries discovered on Mars by Schiaparelli
and Lowell.</p>

<p>As our earth moves round the sun we have, of course, the
changing seasons of the year. In a somewhat similar manner
Mars revolves around the sun, and accordingly this planet has also
its due succession of seasons. There is a summer on Mars, and
there is a winter; during the winter on that globe the poles of
the planet are much colder than at other seasons, and the water
there accumulates in the form of ice or snow to make those ice-caps
that telescopic observers have so long noticed. In this respect
Mars, of course, is like our earth. The ice-cap at each pole of
our globe is so vast that even the hottest summer does not suffice
to melt the accumulation; much of the ice and snow there remains
to form the eternal snow which every arctic explorer so well knows.
It would seem, however, that the contrast between winter and summer
on Mars must be much more deeply marked than the contrast
between winter and summer on our earth. During the summer of
Mars ice and snow vanish altogether from the poles of that planet.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowell supposes that water is so scarce on Mars that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
inhabitants have found it necessary to economize to the utmost
whatever stock there may be of this most necessary element. The
observations at Flagstaff tend to show that the dark lines on Mars
mark the course of the canals by which the water melted in summer
in the arctic regions is conducted over the globe to the tracts
where the water is wanted. Not that the line as we see it represents
actually the water itself; the straight line so characteristic
of Mars’s globe seems rather to correspond to the zones of vegetation
which are brought into culture by means of water that flows
along a canal in its center. In much the same way would the
course of the Nile be exhibited to an inhabitant on Mars who was
directing a telescope toward this earth: the river itself would not
be visible, but the cultivated tracts which owe their fertility to
the irrigation from the river would be broad enough to be distinguishable.
The appearance of these irrigated zones would vary,
of course, with the seasons; and we observe, as might have been
expected, changes in the lines on Mars corresponding to the changes
in the seasons of the planet.</p>

<p>A noteworthy development of astronomy in the last century
has been the erection of mighty telescopes for the study of the
heavens. It must here suffice to mention, as the latest and most
remarkable of these, the famous instrument at the Yerkes Observatory,
which belongs to the University of Chicago. Just as the
century is drawing to its close, the Yerkes telescope has begun to
enter on its sublime task of exhibiting the heavens under greater
advantages than have ever been previously afforded to any astronomers
since the world began.</p>

<p>The University of Chicago having been recently founded, it
was desired to associate with the university an astronomical observatory
which should be worthy of the astonishing place that this
wonderful city has assumed in the world’s history. Mr. Yerkes,
an American millionaire, generously undertook to provide the cost
of this observatory. Two noble disks of glass, forty inches in
diameter, were produced at the furnaces of Messrs. Mantois, in
Paris; these disks were worked by Mr. Alvan Clark, of Boston,
into the famous object glass which, weighing nearly half a ton, has
now been mounted in what we may describe as a temple or a palace
such as had never been dreamed of before in the whole annals of
astronomy.</p>

<p>Perhaps if we could now place the science of the nineteenth
century in its proper perspective the most remarkable discovery
which it contains would be that of the planet Neptune. Indeed,
the whole annals of science present no incident of a more dramatic
character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
It will be remembered that at the latter part of the eighteenth
century William Herschel had immortalized himself by the discovery
of a great planet, to which was presently assigned the name
of Uranus. After the movements of Uranus had been carefully
studied, it was found that on many previous occasions Uranus had
been unwittingly observed by astronomers, who regarded it as a
star. When these observations were all brought together, and
when the track which Uranus followed through the heavens was
thus opened to investigation, it was found that the movements of
the planet presented considerable anomalies. The planet did not
move precisely as it would have moved had it been subjected solely
to the supreme attractive power of the sun. Astronomers are, of
course, accustomed to irregularities of this description in the movements
of the planets. These irregularities have as their origin
the attractions of the various other members of the solar system.
It is possible to submit these attractions to calculation and thus to
estimate their amount. The effect, for instance, of Saturn in disturbing
Jupiter can be allowed for, and the nature of Jupiter’s
motion as thus modified can be precisely estimated. In like manner,
the influence of the earth on Venus can be determined, and so
for the other planets; and thus, generally speaking, it was found
that when the proper allowances had been made for the action of
known causes of disturbance, then the calculated movement of each
planet could be reconciled with observation.</p>

<p>The circumstances of Uranus were, however, in this respect
wholly exceptional. Due allowance was first made for the attraction
of Uranus by Saturn, and for the attraction of Uranus by
Jupiter, as well as by the other planets. It was thus found that
the irregularities of Uranus could be to some extent explained, but
that it was not possible in this manner to account for those irregularities
completely. It was therefore evident that some influence
must be at work affecting the movement of Uranus, in addition
to those arising from any planet of which astronomers hitherto had
cognizance. The only available supposition would be that some
other planet, at present unrecognized, must be in our system, and
that the attraction of this unknown body must give rise to those
irregularities of Uranus which remained still outstanding.</p>

<p>A great problem was thus proposed for mathematicians. It
was nothing less than to affect the determination of the orbit and
the position of this unknown planet, the sole guide to the solution
of the problem being afforded by the discrepancies between the
places of Uranus as actually observed and the places which were
indicated by the calculations, when every allowance had been made
for known causes. The problem was indeed a difficult one, but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
fortunately, two mathematicians proved to be equal to the task
of solving it&mdash;Adams, in England, and Le Verrier, in France.
Each of these astronomers, in independence of the other, succeeded
in determining the place of the planet in the sky. The
dramatic incident of this discovery was afforded when the mathematicians
had done their work. When the place of the planet
had been ascertained, then the telescopic search was undertaken
to verify if it were indeed the case that a planet hitherto unknown
did actually lurk in the spot to which the calculations pointed.
Every one who has ever read a book on astronomy is well acquainted
with the wonderful manner in which this verification was made.
Just where the mathematicians indicated, there was the great planet
discovered! To this object the name of “Neptune” has been
assigned, and its discovery may be said to mark an epoch in the
history of gravitation. It provided a most striking illustration
of the truth of those great laws which Newton had discovered.</p>

<p>The latter half of the century will be also remarkable in the
history of science from the fact that within that period mankind
has been enabled to make some acquaintance with the chemistry
of the celestial bodies. It was in 1859 that Kirchhoff and Bunsen
first expounded to the world the true meaning of the dark lines in
the solar spectrum. In this they were following out a line of reasoning
that had been previously suggested by Prof. Sir G. Stokes,
of Cambridge, England. Those who are at all conversant with
that wonderful branch of knowledge known as spectrum analysis
are aware how these discoveries have rendered it possible for us
to determine in many cases the actual material elements found in
the most distant bodies.</p>

<p>One of the striking results to which this investigation has
led is the demonstration of the substantial unity of the materials
from which the earth and the various heavenly bodies have
been constructed. Those elements which enter most abundantly
into the composition of the earth are also the elements which
appear to enter most abundantly into the composition of the sun
and of the stars. The iron and the hydrogen, the sodium and the
many other materials of which our globe is so largely formed, are
also the selfsame materials which, in widely different proportions
and in very different associations, go to form the heavenly bodies.
This conclusion is as interesting as it was unexpected. It might
naturally have been thought that, seeing the sun is separated from
us by nearly a hundred million miles, and seeing that the stars
are separated from us by millions of millions of miles, all these
celestial bodies must be constructed in quite a different manner
and of substances quite distinct from the substances which we know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
on this earth. But this is not the case. Indeed, at the present
moment it seems doubtful if there be any element which spectrum
analysis has hitherto disclosed in the celestial bodies which is not
also a recognized terrestrial body. The well-known case of helium
gives a striking illustration. In the year 1868 Sir Norman Lockyer
detected the presence of rays in the solar spectrum which were
unknown at that time in terrestrial chemistry. These rays appeared
to emanate from some substance which, though present in
the sun, did not then appear to belong to the earth. This element
was accordingly named “helium,” to indicate its solar origin.
Twenty-five years later Professor Ramsay discovered a substance
on the earth which had been hitherto unrecognized, and which, on
examination, yielded in the spectrum precisely those same rays
which had been found in the so-called helium from the sun. In
consequence of this discovery this element is now recognized as a
terrestrial body. It is indeed a remarkable illustration of the
extraordinary character of modern methods of research that a substance
should have first been discovered at a distance of nearly one
hundred million miles, that same substance being all the time,
though no doubt in very small quantities, a constituent of our
earth as well as of the sun.</p>

<p>Much has been done within the past century in many other
branches of astronomy. I must especially mention the important
subject of meteoric showers. For the development of our knowledge
of this attractive part of astronomy we are largely indebted
to the labors of the late Prof. H. Newton, of Yale. By his investigations,
in conjunction with those of the late Professor Adams,
it was demonstrated that the shower of shooting stars which usually
appears in the middle of November is derived from a shoal of small
bodies which revolve around the sun in an elliptic track, and accomplish
that circuit in about thirty-three years and a quarter. The
earth crosses the track of these meteors in the middle of November.
If it should happen that the great shoal is passing through the
junction at the time the earth also arrives there, then the earth
rushes through the shoal of little bodies. These plunge into our
atmosphere, they are ignited by the friction, and a great shower is
observed. It is thus that we account for the recurrence of specially
superb displays at intervals of about thirty-three years.</p>

<p>But one more great astronomical discovery of this century
must be mentioned, and here again, as in so many other instances,
we are indebted to American astronomers. It was in 1877 that
Prof. Asaph Hall discovered that the planet Mars was attended
by two satellites. This was indeed a great achievement, and
excited the liveliest interest and attention. Since the days when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
telescopes were first invented all the astronomers have been looking
at Mars, and yet they never noticed (their telescopes were not
good enough) those interesting satellites which the acute observation
of Professor Hall detected with the help of the great telescope
of the Naval Observatory at Washington. This discovery was followed
by another of a still more delicate nature, when that consummate
observer, Professor Barnard, using the great Lick telescope,
detected the fifth satellite of Jupiter. This is indeed a most
difficult object to observe, requiring, as it does, the highest optical
power, the most perfect atmospheric conditions, and the most skillful
of astronomical observers. We may take this observation to
represent the high-water mark of telescopic astronomy in the nineteenth
century. This being so, it may fitly conclude this brief
account of some of the most remarkable astronomical discoveries
which that century has produced.</p>

the action of explosives arouses even a livelier interest, since

effects, is set in operation by what appears to be a very slight initial
cause. It is evident on brief consideration that these bodies,
like a coiled spring, a bent bow, or a head of water, are enormous
reservoirs of energy which can be released at a touch, and which, if
the explosive be properly placed in well-proportioned amounts and
discharged at the right time, can be made to do useful and important
work that can not be as conveniently and quickly accomplished
in most cases, and in some cases can not be accomplished at all by
any other means.</p>

<p>The marked characteristic of all explosive substances, and especially
of the so-called high explosives, is that the energy, as developed,
is at high potential, and the uses to which energy in this condition
can be economically put are so manifold that the production
of explosives has become one of the most important of our chemical
industries, this country alone producing, in 1890, 108,735,980
pounds, having a value of nearly $11,000,000.</p>

<p>The number of possible substances possessing explosive properties
is exceedingly large; the number actually known is so great
that it has taxed the ingenuity of inventors to provide them with
suitable names; but these various explosive substances vary to so
great an extent in the energy they will develop in practice and in
their safety in storage, transportation, and use that but a comparatively
small number have met with wide acceptance. All may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
classified under the heads of physical mixtures like gunpowder, or
chemical compounds like nitroglycerin, and they owe their development
of energy to the fact that, like gunpowder, they are mixtures
in which combustible substances such as charcoal are mixed with
supporters of combustion such as niter; or that, like chloride of
nitrogen, they are chemical compounds, the formation of whose
molecules is attended with the absorption of heat; or that, like gun
cotton, they are chemical compounds whose molecules contain both
the combustible and the supporter of combustion, and whose formation
from their elements is attended with the absorption of heat;
while occupying a middle place between the gunpowder and the
gun cotton class, and possessing also to some degree the properties
of the nitrogen-chloride class, are the nitro-substitution explosives,
of which melinite, emmensite, lyddite, and joveite furnish conspicuous
examples.</p>

<p>It may lead to a clearer understanding of what is said regarding
the applications of explosives to dwell briefly on the methods by
which some of them are produced, since, although the raw material
in each case is different and the details of the operations vary, the
underlying principles of the methods are the same, and a good example
is found in the military gun cotton as made by the Abel
process at the United States Naval Torpedo Station.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Gunpowder Grains.</span> <span class="notbold">The large ones are over
five pounds weight, each.</span></div></div>

<p>The material employed is cotton, but whether fresh from the
field or in the form of waste, it must first be freed from dirt by
hand picking and sorting,
and from grease and incrusting
substances by boiling
in a weak soda solution.
The cotton is now dried by
wringing in a centrifugal
wringer and exposing to a
current of hot air in a metal
closet; but as the compacted
mass of cotton holds moisture with great persistency, after partial
drying the cotton is passed through a cotton picker to open the
fiber, so that it not only yields its contained water more readily
and completely, but it also absorbs the acids more speedily in the
dipping process to which it is subsequently exposed.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Extinguishing burning Gun Cotton.</span></div></div>
</div></div>

<p>When the moisture, by the final drying, is reduced to one half
of one per cent the cotton is, while hot, placed in copper tanks
which close hermetically, where it cools to the atmospheric temperature
and in which it is transported to the dipping room, where
a battery of large iron troughs, filled with a mixture of one part of
the most concentrated nitric acid and three parts of the most concentrated
sulphuric acid, set in a large iron water bath to keep the
mixture at a uniform temperature, is placed under a hood against
the wall. The fluffy cotton, in one-pound lots, is dipped handful
by handful under the acid, by means of an iron fork, where it is
allowed to remain for ten minutes, when it is raised to the grating
at the rear of the trough and squeezed with the lever press to remove
the excess of acid. It still retains about ten pounds of the
acid mixture, and in this condition is placed in an acid-proof stoneware
crock, where it is squeezed by another iron press to cause the
contained acid to rise above the surface of the partly converted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
cotton. The covered crock is now placed with others in wooden
troughs containing running water so as to keep the temperature
uniform, where the cotton is allowed to digest for about twenty-four
hours. The acid is then wrung out in a steel centrifugal, and
the wrung gun cotton is thrown in small lots into an immersion
tank containing a large volume of flowing water, in which a paddle
wheel is revolving so as to rapidly dilute and wash away the residual
acid in the gun cotton without permitting any considerable rise
of temperature from the reaction of the water with the acid.</p>

<p>Even these severe means are not enough, for, as the cotton fiber
is in the form of hairlike tubes, traces of the acid sufficient to bring
about the subsequent decomposition of the gun cotton are retained
by capillarity. Therefore, after boiling with a dilute solution of
sodium carbonate, the gun cotton is pulped and washed in a beater
or rag engine until the fiber is reduced to the fineness of corn meal,
and a sample of it will pass the “heat test.” This is a test of the
resistance of gun cotton
to decomposition, and requires
that when the air-dried
sample of gun cotton
is heated to 65.5° C. in a
closed tube in which a moistened strip of potassium iodide and
starch paper is suspended, the paper should not become discolored
in less than fifteen minutes’ exposure.</p>

<p>This pulping of the gun cotton not only enables one to more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
completely purify it, but it also renders it possible to mold it into
convenient forms and to compress it so as to greatly increase its
efficiency in use. For this purpose the pulp is suspended in water
and pumped to a molding press, where, under a hydraulic pressure
of one hundred pounds to the square inch, it is molded into cylinders
or prisms about three inches in diameter and five inches and
a half high, and these are compressed to two inches in height by
a final press exerting a pressure of about sixty-eight hundred pounds
to the square inch. As this is regarded as a somewhat hazardous
operation, the press is surrounded by a mantlet woven from stout
rope to protect the workmen from flying pieces of metal in case
of an accident. The operation
is analogous to that
employed in powder-making,
where the gunpowder
has been pressed in a great
variety of forms and into
single grains weighing several
pounds apiece.</p>

When confined in the chamber of a gun or the bore-hole of a rock,
gun cotton will burn like gunpowder when ignited, if dry, and produce
an explosion, but, in common
with nitroglycerin and other high
explosives, gun cotton is best exploded
and develops its maximum
effect when detonated, a result
which is secured by exploding a
small quantity of mercury fulminate
in contact with the dry
material.</p>

<p>Mercury fulminate is made by
dissolving mercury in nitric acid
and pouring the solution thus produced
into alcohol, when a violent reaction takes place and the fulminate
is deposited as a crystalline gray powder. This powder is
loaded in copper cases and, after drying, it is primed with dry-mealed
gun cotton, the mouth of the case being closed with a sulphur-glass
plug, through which pass two copper leading wires joined by a bridge
of platinum-iridium wire, two one-thousandths of an inch in diameter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
which becomes heated to incandescence when an electric current
is sent through it. This device is what is known as the naval detonator.
Mercury fulminate is so employed because it is the most violent
of all explosives in common use, and exerts a pressure of forty-eight
thousand atmospheres when fired in contact. Although the
naval detonator contains but thirty-five grains of mercury fulminate,
yet it will rupture stout iron and heavy tin torpedo cases when fired
suspended in them, it will rend thick blocks of wood when placed in
a hole and fired within them, and it will even pierce holes through
plates of the finest wrought iron one-sixteenth inch in thickness if
only the base of the detonator is in contact with the plate, and this
has been used as a test of their efficiency. Its force is markedly
shown by firing one in a stout iron cylinder filled with water and
closed tightly, when the cylinder is blown into a shredded sphere.
When used to detonate gun cotton, either when confined or in the
open, the detonator is placed in the hole which has been molded
in the center of the gun cotton disk or block, so that it shall be
in close contact with the gun cotton.
I have found that perfectly dry compressed
gun cotton is detonated by
2.83 grains of mercury fulminate;
but as a torpedo attack is necessarily
in the nature of a forlorn hope
and should be provided with every
possible provision against failure, and since if the detonator fails
the attack fails, the naval detonator is supplied with thirty-five
grains, so as to give a large coefficient of assurance.</p>

A characteristic feature of gun cotton is that it may be detonated
even when completely saturated with and immersed in water,
if only some dry gun cotton be detonated
in contact with it. Thus in one
experiment a disk of dry gun cotton was
covered with a water-proof coating and
the detonator inserted in the detonator
hole of this disk. This dry disk was laid
upon four uncoated disks, the five lashed
tightly together, and sunk in Newport
Harbor, where the column remained
until the uncoated disks were saturated
with salt water, when the mine was fired
and the saturated disks were found by
measurement of the work done to have
been completely exploded. I have found
that three ounces of dry compressed
gun cotton will cause the detonation
of wet compressed gun cotton in contact with it, but forty
ounces of dry gun cotton are used as the primer in our naval
mines and torpedoes, so as to give a large coefficient of assurance.</p>

<p>In the mining and other industries the fulminate is used in
smaller quantities and it is generally mixed with potassium chlorate,
the mixture being compressed
in small copper cases
and sold as blasting caps.
They are fired by means of a
piece of Bickford or running
fuse, consisting of a woven
cotton or hemp tube containing
a core of gunpowder,
which is inserted in the mouth
of the copper cap and made
fast within it by crimping.
The capped fuse is then inserted
in a dynamite cartridge
so that the cap is firmly in
contact with the dynamite,
the mouth of the cartridge
is fastened securely, and the
charge inserted in the bore-hole
in the rock and tamped. The protruding end of the fuse is
lighted, and the fire travels at the rate of three feet per minute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
down the train of gunpowder to the fulminate, which then detonates
and causes the detonation of the dynamite.</p>

<p>Although gun cotton, nitroglycerin, and their congeners can
be and usually are fired by detonation, there has within recent
years been a great number of compositions invented which, while
formed from gun cotton alone or mixtures of it with nitroglycerin,
burn progressively when ignited and are therefore available for
use as propellants; and since the products of their burning are
almost wholly gaseous, they produce but little or no smoke and
are therefore called smokeless powders. As upward of fifty-seven
per cent of the products of the burning of ordinary gunpowder
are solids or easily compressed vapors, this comparative smokelessness
of the modern powders is a very important characteristic, and
when used in battle they seriously modify our former accepted
methods of handling troops. While this is the feature of these
powders which has attracted popular attention, a far more important
quality which they possess is the power to impart to a projectile
a much higher velocity than black powder does, without
exerting an undue pressure on the gun. A velocity of over twenty-four
hundred feet per second has been imparted to a one-hundred-pound
projectile with the powder that I have invented for our
navy, while the pressure on the gun was less than fifteen tons to
the square inch.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Torpedo Practice.</span> <span class="notbold">Bow discharge.</span></div></div>

<p>Prior to my work in this field all the so-called smokeless powders
were mixtures of several ingredients, resembling gunpowder
in this respect. But, considering the precise and difficult work
that was expected of these high-powered powders and the difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
which had always been found in securing uniformity in mixtures,
and that this difficulty had become the more apparent as the gun became
more highly developed, I sought to produce a powder which
should consist of a single chemical substance in a state of chemical
purity, and which could be formed into grains of such form and
size as were most suitable for the piece in which the powder was
to be used.</p>

<p>I succeeded in so treating cellulose nitrate of the highest degree
of nitration as to convert it into a mass like ivory and yet
leave it pure. In this indurated condition the gun cotton will
burn freely, but it has not been possible to detonate it even when
closely confined and exposed to the initial detonation of large
masses of mercury fulminate.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Torpedo Practice on the Cushing.</span> <span class="notbold">Broadside discharge.</span></div></div>

<p>I am happy to say that this principle has now been adopted
by the Russian Government, and by our navy in its specifications
for smokeless powder; but they have, I think unwisely, selected
a cellulose nitrate containing 12.5 per cent or less of nitrogen instead
of that of the highest nitration.</p>

<p>This work was completed, a factory established, and the processes
well marked out when I left the torpedo station in 1892.
Besides this, there were then already commercial works established
elsewhere in this country for the manufacture of the nitroglycerin-nitrocellulose
powders of the ballistite class, while large quantities
of many varieties could be easily procured abroad. Considering
these facts, and that France and Germany had already
adopted smokeless powders in 1887, that Italy adopted one in
1888, and England about the same time, it is unpardonable that
our services should not yet have adopted any of the smokeless powders
available when we were drawn into the conflict with Spain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
Besides their use as ballistic agents, gun cotton, dynamite, and
explosive gelatin in their ordinary condition have found employment
and been adopted as service explosives in military and naval
mining, as their great energy and the violence with which they
explode, even when unconfined, especially adapt them for use in
the various kinds of torpedoes and mines which are in vogue in
the service.</p>

<p>One form of these torpedoes was attached to the end of a spar
or pole which was rigged out from the bow of a launch or vessel
so that it could be thrust under the enemy’s vessel, and the detonators
of such spar torpedoes were not only connected with electric
generators, so that they could be fired at will, but they, in
common with mines, were frequently provided with a system of
levers so arranged that the enemy’s vessel fired the torpedoes and
mines automatically as it came in contact with the levers. It
was with such a contact-spar torpedo, containing thirty-three
pounds of gun cotton, that the schooner Joseph Henry was blown
up in Newport Harbor in 1884.</p>

<p>There are many types of the automobile torpedo. Among
them the Hall, Patrick, Whitehead, and Howell may be cited.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
The first three are propelled by the energy resident in compressed
gases; the Howell by the energy stored in a heavy fly wheel, which
also, by acting on the gyroscopic principle, serves to maintain the
direction imparted to the torpedo as it is launched. The Hall,
Whitehead, and Howell are launched from tubes or guns by means
of light powder charges, and are independent of exterior control
after launching. The Patrick is launched from ways, and is controlled
from the shore or boat by a wire through which an electric
current may be sent to its steering mechanism. The charges
are quite variable, but the war heads of the larger torpedoes contain
as much as five hundred pounds of gun cotton.</p>

<span class="subhead small notbold"><span class="smcap">By Prof. CESARE LOMBROSO.</span></span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">While</span> I have had the privilege of making several indirect
studies of anarchists by means of the data furnished by
legal processes, the journals, and the handwriting of the subjects,
I have only rarely been able to examine one directly and make
those measurements and craniological determinations upon him
without which any study can be only approximate, or, we might
even say, hypothetical. I had, however, an opportunity a short
time ago to observe a real anarchist in person, and study him according
to the methods of my criminological clinic. The results
have been singular, and it seems to me that they should cast some
light upon the dark world of these agitators, and especially upon
the phenomena of the strange contradictions presented in their
life; manifestations which jurists and police officers, intent only
on achieving the judicial triumph of a conviction, consider and call
simulations and falsehoods.</p>

<p>He was a fellow who had caused a great excitement, during the
crowded days of the exposition at Turin, by saying that he wanted
to kill the king. In fact, he gave himself up to the police, saying
that the anarchists of Alexandria were seeking the assassination
of the king, and had written him a letter directing him to arm
himself, but that he, wishing anything else than to commit regicide,
had surrendered in order to denounce the scheme. There was no
real basis of criminal intent, but our police put him in prison,
and there I found him.</p>

<p>His physiognomy presented all the characteristics of the born
criminal and of the foolhardy and sanguinary anarchist. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
flaring ears, premature and deep wrinkles, small, sinister eyes sunk
back in their orbits, a hollowed flat nose, and small beard&mdash;in short,
he presented an extraordinary resemblance to Ravachol, as may be
seen from their portraits.</p>

<p>The cranium was a little smaller than the normal, and the
upper part of the skull was much rounded and deformed, with a
cephalic index of 91&mdash;considerably more rounded than the head
of Luccheni. The horizontal
fold of the hand was of a
type much like that of Ravachol.</p>

<p>I add that the biological
study, which was made directly,
and therefore more
satisfactorily than was practicable
with Caserio and Luccheni,
revealed a series of
very singular anomalies; a
touch six times more obtuse
than the normal&mdash;six millimetres
on the right, five on
the left; a remarkably blunt
sensitiveness to pain and dull
perception of location; an
extraordinarily reduced visual
field, particularly in the
left eye; a somewhat tremulous
handwriting, and slight
defects of articulation in
speech; and thin hair. There
was nothing very striking in
his affective nature. He spoke kindly of his parents, whom he
would be glad to see. But he had a blunt moral sense, and had
committed frequent thefts, especially against his family, so that he
had been put into a house of correction. And it was just while
he was still in this establishment, at sixteen years of age, that he
pretended to have been invited to attend a meeting of about thirty
anarchists at Brescia, where he was made to swear, kissing a dagger,
to kill the king. He described the room, and spoke of the
individual persons present, and then said that he thought no more
of the matter after he returned to the house; but a few days ago
it had come into his mind to go to the post office, and there he had
found a letter from the anarchists of Alexandria, urging him to
arm himself to kill the king.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
He repeated this story minutely and with great persistence,
notwithstanding the postal authorities denied having given him the
letter, in the face of the asseverations of the prefects that there
were not thirty anarchists in Brescia, where he was in correction,
and although all the facts were against him. Observe that he
was in prison, that he had been there three months, and that
he was told he would be likely to stay there as long as he adhered
to his story.</p>

<p>Efforts to account for the phenomenon were unsuccessful, because
his friends and relatives made no mention of any traces of
insanity. Light began to break upon the case when it was learned
that he had attempted suicide, a few years before, in grief at the
death of his mother, and also that on the day before he gave himself
up he had stolen a small sum from his drunken brother.
These, however, were only distant hints. The matter was fully
explained when, after he had drunk a litre of wine in the prison,
he began to exclaim, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Viva l’anarchio!</i>” (Hurrah for anarchy!),
“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Morte al Re!</i>” (Death to the king!), to kiss a dagger, to break
various things against imaginary guards, and, after a short period
of quiet, to swear and forswear himself that his companions had
done what he had done, that
they had shouted for anarchy,
had broken the vases, and had
desired to kill the king.</p>

<p>This cleared up the matter at
once for me, but I wished to
complete the elucidation with
an experiment. I began by giving
him ten, then twenty, then
thirty, then forty grammes of alcohol,
up to eighty. I observed
that his personality began to
change after forty grammes.
He became somewhat insolent
and suspicious, and had vague
delirious imaginings of persecutions.
When invited to sing
anarchistic songs he refused, evidently fearing to compromise
himself, but sang them voluntarily in an undertone. When
the dose of alcohol was increased to ninety grammes his personality
seemed immediately to undergo a full change; his touch became
twice as fine (three millimetres), and his visual field increased
threefold; he declared that there was a spy around. When
put into his cell he sang anarchistic hymns, threatened death to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
the king, handled a box as if brandishing a dagger, climbed
to a window and insulted the sentinel, resisted five men who
tried to disarm him, and continued in this condition for eight
hours.</p>

<p>The next day he denied having done any of these things, avowed
that he was a good monarchist and a good citizen, and declared distinctly
that he had not done
what he had done, in the
face of the concurrent testimony
of several witnesses.
On renewing the experiment
a few days afterward
with eighty grammes of alcohol,
the same series of
phenomena recurred&mdash;a
real anarchistic raving, a
genuine mania for regicide,
which would certainly
have ended in some act if
he had not been restrained
by force; and this person,
who had at first presented
an evident obtusity of
touch and an extraordinary
contraction of the visual
field, now exhibited an almost
normal touch of three millimetres and a visual field enlarged
to triple its extent when he was sober.</p>

<p>On the day after this he recollected none of all the things that
had happened the day before. This double personality was determined
in him by alcohol, as it is in others by misery or by fanaticism,
while it rests with all upon a congenital basis. The fact
helps us to explain how some inoffensive man may have a type of
physiognomy quite similar to that of Ravachol, showing how often
there are true criminals in potency, whose physiognomy, or rather
the anomalies of it, bears a prophetic relation to the crime which
breaks out on the first determining circumstance. And we have
here another explanation of such contradictory characters as those
of Ravachol, Caserio, and Luccheni, who, having been once well-behaved,
end by becoming criminals.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Of</span> all the wonderful operations accomplished by the aid of
electricity at the present time, none so completely mystifies
the beholder as the action of the trolley car. The electric light,
although incomprehensible to the average layman, does not excite
his curiosity to the same extent. The glowing filament of an incandescent
lamp or the dazzling carbon points of an arc light stimulate
the inquisitive proclivities to some extent, but as the popular
notion with respect to the nature of electricity is that it is some
kind of fluid that can flow through wires and other things like water
through a pipe, the conclusion arrived at is that the current, in its
passage through the filament or the carbon points, generates a sufficient
amount of heat to raise the temperature of the material to
the luminous point. The fact that energy is required to raise the
temperature of the mass to the incandescent point is not taken into
consideration by those not versed in technical matters, owing to
the fact that, as nothing moves, it is not supposed that power can
be expended. When a trolley car is seen coming down the street
at a high rate of speed the effect upon the mind is very different.
Here we see a vast amount of weight propelled at a high velocity,
and yet the only source through which the power to accomplish
this result is supplied is a small wire. The mystifying cause does
not stop here, for if we look further into the matter we see that
the energy has to pass from the trolley wire to the car through
the very small contact between it and the trolley wheel. After
contemplating these facts, it appears remarkable that the energy
that can creep through this diminutive passage can by any means
be made to develop the force necessary to propel a car with a
heavy load up a steep grade. An electrical engineer, if asked to
explain the action, would say that the force of magnetic attraction
was made use of to accomplish the result, but this explanation
would fail to throw any light upon the subject. In what follows,
it is proposed to explain the matter in a simple manner, and then
it will be seen that what appears to be an incomprehensible mystery,
when not understood, is, in fact, no mystery at all.</p>

<p>Electricity and magnetism are two forces that are intimately
associated with each other, and, although radically different, it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>difficult, if not impossible, to obtain one without the other, although
it is a simple matter to make one inactive under certain conditions.
It is very generally understood that a magnet possesses the power
of attraction, and that it will draw toward it pieces of iron, steel,
and other magnets. The laws governing the attractive properties
of magnets, however, are not so well understood, and many are
not aware of the fact that under certain conditions one magnet
will repel another, but such is nevertheless the case.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs. 1, 2, 3.&mdash;Diagrams illustrating the
Attraction and Repulsion of Magnets.</span></div></div>

<p>In <a href="#ip_317">Fig. 1</a> the lower outline, <i>M</i>, represents a magnet fixed in
position, and the upper bar represents another magnet arranged
to swing freely around the pivot <i>a</i>. A magnet, as is generally
known, will arrange itself in a north-to-south position if suspended
from its center, like a scale beam, and allowed to swing freely, and
the same end will always point toward the north. On this account
the ends of a magnet are called its poles, and the one that will
point toward the north is designated
the north pole, while the
other one is the south pole. The
terms north and south poles were
applied to magnets centuries ago,
but at the present time the ends
are more commonly designated
as positive and negative. In <a href="#ip_317">Fig. 1</a>
it will be noticed that the stationary
magnet has its positive
end upward, and this attracts the
negative end of the swinging
magnet. If the order of the
poles is reversed, so that the positive of the swinging magnet will
come opposite the positive of the stationary one, then there will
be a repulsive action instead of an attraction, as is shown in <a href="#ip_317">Fig. 2</a>.
If the two negative ends were placed opposite, the effect would
be the same. From this we see that to obtain an attraction we
must place the magnets so that opposite poles come together, and
that by reversing the order we obtain a repulsive action.</p>

<p>If the swinging magnet is replaced by a bar of iron, as is shown
in <a href="#ip_317">Fig. 3</a>, there will be an attraction, no matter what end of the
magnet may be uppermost, thus showing that either end of a magnet
will attract a bar of iron. The explanation of these different
actions is that when two magnets are brought into proximity to
each other each one exerts its force without any regard to the
other, and if the two are set to act together they will attract one
another, but if set to act in opposition they will repel. When one
of the bars is not a magnet, but simply a piece of iron or steel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
this bar, having no attractive or repulsive force of its own, can
only obey the attractive action of the other, which is the only one
that exerts a force.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs 4, 5.&mdash;Diagrams illustrating the Method
of obtaining Rotary Motion with Magnets.</span></div></div>

<p>In <a href="#ip_318">Fig. 4</a> <i>M</i> is a magnet bent into the form of a U, commonly
called a horseshoe magnet. The short bar set between the upper
ends is also a magnet, and is arranged so as to revolve around the
shaft <i>s</i>. From what has just been explained in connection with
<a href="#ip_317">Figs. 1 and 2</a> it will be understood that, with the poles as indicated
by the letters, there will be an attractive force set up between
the top end of the straight bar and the <i>P</i> end of the horseshoe,
and thus rotation will be produced in the direction of the
arrow. The rotation, however, will necessarily stop when the bar
reaches the position shown in <a href="#ip_318">Fig. 5</a>, for then the attraction between
the poles will resist further movement. If the straight bar
were not a magnet, but simply a piece of iron or steel, it is evident
that when in the position of <a href="#ip_318">Fig. 4</a> the attraction would be just
as much toward the right as
toward the left, and if the
bar were placed accurately in
the central position it would
not swing in either direction.
It would be in the condition
called, in mechanics, unstable
equilibrium. In practice this
condition could not be very
well realized, as it would be
difficult to set and retain the
bar in a position where the
attraction from both sides would be the same, therefore the rotation
would be in one direction or the other; but whichever way
the bar might move, it would only swing through one quarter of
a revolution, into the horizontal position of <a href="#ip_318">Fig. 5</a>.</p>

<p>If we reflect upon these actions we can see that if we could
destroy the magnetism of both parts before the straight bar reaches
the position of <a href="#ip_318">Fig. 5</a> it would be possible to obtain rotation through
a greater distance than one quarter of a turn, for then the headway
acquired by the rotating part would cause it to continue its
motion. If, after the completion of one half of a revolution, we
could remagnetize both parts, we would then set up an attraction
between the lower end of the straight bar and the left side of the
horseshoe, for then the polarity of the former would be the reverse
of that shown in <a href="#ip_318">Fig. 4</a>&mdash;that is, the lower end would be negative.
By means of this second attraction we would cause the bar to rotate
through the third quarter of the revolution, and if, just before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
completing this last quarter, we were to remove all the magnetism
again, the headway would keep up the motion through the final
quarter of the revolution, thus completing one full turn. From
this it will be realized that if we could magnetize and demagnetize
the two parts twice in each revolution a continuous rotation could
be obtained.</p>

<p>If the magnetizing and demagnetizing action were only applied
to the rotating part we would fail to keep up a continuous rotation,
for, as was shown in connection with <a href="#ip_317">Fig. 3</a>, the action when
the straight bar reached the position of <a href="#ip_318">Fig. 5</a> would be the same
as if it were magnetized, owing to the fact that a magnet always
exerts an attraction upon a mass of iron. Suppose, however, that
we were to reverse the polarity of the rotating part just as it
reaches the position of <a href="#ip_318">Fig. 5</a>, then there would be two poles of
the same polarity opposite each other, and, as shown in <a href="#ip_317">Fig. 2</a>,
the force acting between them would be repulsive, and would push
the bar around in the direction of rotation. Not only would the
right-side pole of the horseshoe force the end of the bar away from
it, but the negative pole, on the left side, would attract this same
end, and thus a force would be exerted by the two poles of <i>M</i> to
keep up the rotation through the next half of a circle. On reaching
this last position the rotation would stop if the polarity of the
revolving bar were left unchanged, for then the poles facing each
other would be of opposite polarity. If, however, we again reversed
the polarity, a repulsion would be set up between the poles
facing each other, and thus a force would be exerted to continue
the rotation. Thus we see that if the polarity of the horseshoe
magnet is not disturbed it is necessary to reverse that of the rotating
part to obtain a continuous motion, but if we change the magnetic
conditions of both parts, then it is only necessary to magnetize
and demagnetize them alternately.</p>

<p>From the foregoing it is seen that there are two ways in which
the force of magnetism could be utilized to keep up a continuous
rotation, and the question now is, Can either of them be made
available in practice? To this we answer that, by the aid of the
relations existing between electricity and magnetism, both can be
and are made available, as will be shown in the following paragraphs:</p>

<div id="ip_319" class="figleft" style="width: 331px;">
  <img src="images/illo_034.jpg" width="331" height="197" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs. 6, 7, 8.&mdash;Diagrams illustrating the Principles of Electro-Magnets.</span></div></div>

<p>In <a href="#ip_319">Fig. 6</a> <i>W</i> represents a coil of wire provided with a cotton
covering, so that there may be no actual contact between the adjoining
convolutions. If the ends <i>p n</i> of this coil are connected
with a source of electric energy, an electric current will flow
through it, and if a bar, as indicated by <i>N P</i>, of iron or steel is
placed within the coil it will become magnetized. If the bar is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
made of steel and is hardened it will retain the magnetism, and
become what is called a permanent magnet; such a magnet, in fact,
as we have considered in all the previous figures. If the bar is
made of iron it will not retain the magnetism, but will only be a
magnet as long as the electric
current flows through
the coil <i>W</i>. A magnet of
the latter type is called
an electro-magnet. If the
iron is of poor quality&mdash;that
is, from an electrical
standpoint&mdash;it will require
an appreciable time to lose
its magnetism, but if it is
soft and high grade, electrically
considered, it will
lose its magnetism instantly, or nearly so. If we take two bars of
soft iron and arrange them side by side, as in <a href="#ip_319">Fig. 7</a>, and wind coils
around them as indicated each one will become magnetized when
the ends <i>p n</i> of the coils are connected with an electric circuit. If
the lower ends of the two bars are joined by a piece, as shown at
<i>M</i>, we will have a horseshoe electro-magnet. If we take a round
disk of iron, as in <a href="#ip_319">Fig. 8</a>, and wind a coil around it, it will also
become a magnet when an electric current traverses the coil. Thus
it will be seen that it makes little difference what the shape of the
iron may be, providing it is surrounded by a coil of wire and an
electric current is passed through the latter. This being the case,
it is evident that either of the processes explained in connection
with <a href="#ip_318">Figs. 4 and 5</a> can be made available for the production of a
continuous rotation by the aid of electro-magnets. Suppose we
make a drum, as shown in <a href="#ip_320">Fig. 9</a>, and wind a wire coil around it in
the direction indicated, then when a current passes through the
wire the drum will be magnetized, with poles at top and bottom.
If the electric current passes through the wire from end <i>p</i> to end <i>n</i>
the drum will be magnetized positively at the top and negatively at
the bottom, and if the direction of the current through the wire
is reversed the polarity of the drum will be reversed. If we construct
a horseshoe magnet of the shape shown in <a href="#ip_320">Fig. 10</a>, and place
within the circular opening between its ends the drum of <a href="#ip_320">Fig. 9</a>,
we will have a device that is capable of developing a continuous
rotation, providing we have suitable means for reversing the direction
of the electric current through the wire coil; and this machine
constitutes an electric motor in its simplest form.</p>

<div id="ip_320" class="figcenter" style="width: 441px;">
  <img src="images/illo_035.jpg" width="441" height="317" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs. 9, 10.&mdash;Diagrams illustrating the Principles of the Electric Motor.</span></div></div>

<p>In an electric motor the horseshoe magnet is called the field<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
magnet, and the rotating part is called the armature, while the
device by means of which the direction of the current through the
armature coil is reversed is called the commutator. In this last figure
it will be noticed that the coils wound upon the field magnet are
represented as of wire much finer than that wound upon the armature.
In actual practice machines are sometimes wound in this
way, and sometimes the field wire is twice as large as that on the
armature. When the field wire is very much finer than that of
the armature the machine is what is known as shunt wound, which
means that only a small portion of the current that passed through
the armature passes through the field coils. Although with this
type of winding the current that passes through the field coils is
very weak, the magnetism developed thereby can be made greater
than that of the armature if desired. This result is accomplished
by increasing the number of turns of wire in the field coils. Thus
if the current through the armature is one hundred times as strong
as that through the field coils, the latter can be made to equal the
effect of the former by increasing the number of turns in the proportion
of one hundred to one, and if the increase is still greater
the field coils will develop the strongest magnetism. The reason
why a small current passing around a magnet a great many times
will develop as strong a magnetization as a large current, can be
readily understood when we say that the magnetism is in proportion
to the total strength of the electric current that circulates
around the magnet. Suppose we have two currents, one of which is
one thousand times as strong as the other, then if the weak one is
passed through a coil consisting of one thousand turns it will develop
just as strong a magnetization as the large current passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
through a coil of only one turn. This last explanation enables
us to see how it is that the comparatively small current that can
pass through the contact between the trolley wire and the trolley
wheel can develop in the motor force sufficient to propel a heavy
car up a steep grade. When that small current reaches the car
motors it passes through a thousand or more turns of wire, and
thus its effect is increased a corresponding number of times.</p>

<p>A motor having a single coil of wire upon the armature, as in
<a href="#ip_320">Fig. 10</a>, would not give very satisfactory results, owing to the fact
that the rotative force developed by it would not be uniform.
Such motors are made in very small sizes, but never when a machine
of any capacity is required. For large machines it is necessary
to wind the armature with a number of coils, so that the
rotating force may be uniform, and also so that the current may
be reversed by the commutator without producing sparks so large
as to destroy the device. When an armature is wound with a
number of coils the direction of the current is reversed, by the
commutator, in each coil as it reaches the point where its usefulness
ends, and where, if it continued to flow in the same direction,
it would act to hold the armature back. The effect of this reversal
of the current in one coil after another is to maintain the
polarity of the armature practically at the same point, so that the
strongest pull is exerted between it and the field magnet poles at
all times. To explain clearly the way in which the commutator
reverses the current in one coil at a time it will be necessary to
make use of a diagram illustrating what is called a ring armature.
Such a diagram is shown in <a href="#ip_323">Fig. 11</a>. The ring <i>A</i> is the armature
core, and is made of iron; the wire coils are represented as consisting
of one turn to each coil, and are marked <i>w w w</i>. The current
enters the wire through the spring <i>B</i>, and passes out through <i>C</i>.
As can be seen, the current from <i>B</i> can flow through the coils
<i>w w</i> in both directions, thus dividing into two currents, each one
of which will traverse one half of the wire wound upon the armature.
The two half currents will meet at <i>C</i>. If the armature is
rotated the springs <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> (which are called commutator brushes)
will pass from one turn of the wire coil to another just back of it
as the rotation progresses, and each time that contact is made with
a new turn the direction of the current in the turn just ahead will
be reversed. The current in the wire as a whole, however, will
always be in the same direction&mdash;that is, in all the turns to the
right of the two brushes; the current will flow toward the center
of the shaft on the front side of the armature, and away from the
shaft in all the turns on the left side. As the direction of the current
on opposite sides of the brushes is always the same, the poles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
of the armature will remain under <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>, therefore the relation
between the position of the poles of the armature and the field
magnet will be the same substantially as that illustrated in <a href="#ip_320">Fig. 10</a>,
and, as a result, the force tending to produce rotation will at all
times be the greatest possible for the strength of the current used
and the size of the magnets.</p>

<p>Armatures are wound with a number of turns of wire in each
coil, unless the machine is very large, and present an appearance
more like <a href="#ip_323">Fig. 12</a>. In this figure the brushes are arranged to make
contact with the outer surface of the ring <i>C</i>, which is the commutator.
The segments <i>s s</i> are connected with the ends of the armature
coils <i>c c c</i>, but are separated from each other by some kind
of material that will not conduct electricity&mdash;that is, they are electrically
insulated. As will be noticed from this, the armature
in <a href="#ip_323">Fig. 11</a> acts as a commutator as well as an armature, its
outer surface performing the former office. In the winding the
difference between <a href="#ip_323">Figs. 11 and 12</a> is simply in the number of
turns in each coil, there being one turn in <a href="#ip_323">Fig. 11</a> and several
in <a href="#ip_323">Fig. 12</a>.</p>

<div id="ip_323" class="figcenter" style="width: 477px;">

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs. 11, 12.&mdash;Diagrams illustrating the Method of winding Armatures of Electric
Motors and Generators.</span></div></div>

<p>The armature shown in <a href="#ip_320">Fig. 10</a> is of the type called drum armature,
but it can be wound so as to produce the same result as the
ring, although it is not so easy to explain this style of winding. It
will be sufficient for the present explanation to say that whatever
type of armature may be used, the winding is always such that the
direction of the current through the wire coils is reversed progressively,
so that the magnetic polarity is maintained practically
at the same point; therefore there is a continuous pull between
this point of the armature core and the poles of the field magnet.
The commutator is secured to the armature shaft, and the brushes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
through which the current enters and leaves are held stationary;
keeping this fact in mind, it can be seen at once that in <a href="#ip_323">Fig. 12</a> the
current will flow from the brush <i>a</i> through the two sides of the armature
wire to brush <i>b</i>, hence all the coils on the right of the vertical
line will be traversed by the current in the same direction&mdash;that
is, either to or from the center of the shaft&mdash;and in the coils
on the left the direction will be opposite, which is just the same
order as was explained in connection with <a href="#ip_323">Fig. 11</a>.</p>

<div id="ip_324" class="figleft" style="width: 306px;">
  <img src="images/illo_038.jpg" width="306" height="121" alt="" />
    <div class="captionh"><span class="smcap">Figs. 13, 14.&mdash;Diagrams illustrating the Difference
between an Elec&shy;tric Motor and
a Generator.</span></div></div>

<p>An electric motor can be turned into an electric generator by
simply reversing the direction in which the armature rotates&mdash;that
is, any electric machine is either a generator or a motor. This
fact can be illustrated by means of <a href="#ip_324">Figs. 13 and 14</a>, both of which
show the armature and the poles of the field magnet. The first
figure represents an electric motor, and, as can be seen, the pull
between the <i>N</i> pole of the armature and the <i>P</i> pole of the field is
in the direction of arrow <i>b</i>, hence the armature will rotate in
the same direction, as indicated by arrow <i>a</i>. To obtain the
polarity of the armature and field it is necessary to pass an electric
current through both&mdash;that is to say, we must expend electrical
energy to obtain power from the machine. As soon as the
current ceases to flow, the polarity of the armature and field dies
out, and the rotation of the former comes to an end. The magnetism,
however, does not die out entirely; a small residue is always
left, although it is never sufficient to produce rotation, and
even if it were it could only cause the armature to revolve through
one quarter of a turn. If, after the current has been shut off,
the armature shaft is rotated in the reverse direction, as indicated
by arrow <i>a</i> in <a href="#ip_324">Fig. 14</a>, the motion will be against the pull of the
magnetism; therefore, although the poles may be very weak, an
amount of power sufficient to overcome their attraction must be
applied to the pulley, otherwise rotation can not be accomplished.
In consequence of the backward
rotation a current is
generated in the armature
coils, and this current, as it
traverses the field coils as
well as those of the armature,
causes the polarity of both
parts to increase. As a result
of the increased polarity the
resistance to rotation is increased, and more power has to be applied
to the pulley. The increase in the strength of the poles results in
increasing the current generated, and this in turn further increases
the pole strength, so that one effect helps the other, the result being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
that the current, which starts with an infinitesimal strength, soon
rises to the maximum capacity of the machine.</p>

<p>The motor shown in <a href="#ip_320">Fig. 10</a> does not in any way resemble an
electric railway motor, nevertheless the principle of action is precisely
the same in both. The design of a machine of any kind has
to conform to the practical requirements, and this is true of railway
motors, just as it is true of printing presses, sawmills, or any
other mechanism. A railway motor must be designed to run at
a comparatively slow speed and to develop a strong rotative force,
or torque, as it is technically called. It must also be so constructed
that it will not be injured if covered with mud and water. It must
be compact, strong, and light, and capable of withstanding a severe
strain without giving out. To render the machine water- and mud-proof
it is formed with an outer iron shell, which entirely incases
the internal parts. The first railway motors were not inclosed,
and the result was that they frequently came to grief from the
effects of a shower of mud. When the modern inclosed type of
motor, which is called the iron-clad type, first made its appearance
it was frequently spoken of as the clam-shell type, and the name
is not altogether inappropriate, for while the outside may be covered
with mud to such an extent as to entirely obliterate the design,
the interior will remain perfectly clean and dry, and therefore
its effectiveness will not be impaired.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 15.&mdash;External View of Electric Railway Motor mounted upon Car-Wheel Axle.</span></div></div>

<p>To enable the motor to give a strong torque and run at a slow
speed the number of poles in the field and armature is increased.
The design of <a href="#ip_320">Fig. 10</a> has two poles in the field and two in the
armature, and is what is known as the bipolar type. Machines
having more than two poles in each part are called multipolar
machines. The number of poles can be increased by pairs, but
not by a single pole&mdash;that is, we can have four, six, eight, or
any other even number of poles, but not five, seven, or any odd
number. This is owing to the fact that there must always be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
as many positive as negative poles, no more and no less. Railway
motors at the present time are made with four poles. The
external appearance can be understood from <a href="#ip_325">Fig. 15</a>, while <a href="#ip_326">Fig. 16</a>
and <a href="#ip_327">Fig. 17</a> will serve to elucidate the internal construction.
In <a href="#ip_325">Fig. 15</a> the motor casing is marked <i>M</i>, and, as will be seen,
it forms a complete shell. The motion of the armature shaft is
transmitted to the car-wheel axle <i>F</i> through a pinion, which engages
with a spur gear secured to the latter. In <a href="#ip_326">Fig. 16</a> the pinion
and gear are marked <i>N</i> and <i>L</i> respectively. As it is necessary
that the armature shaft and the axle be kept in perfect alignment,
the motor casing <i>M</i> is provided with suitable bearings for both,
those for the armature shaft being marked <i>P P</i> in <a href="#ip_326">Fig. 16</a>, and one
of those for the axle being marked <i>T</i> in <a href="#ip_325">Fig. 15</a>. It will be understood
from the foregoing that the motor is mounted so as to swing
around the car-wheel axle as a center, but, as it is not desirable to
have all this dead weight resting upon the wheels without any elasticity,
the motor is carried by the crossbars <i>B B</i>, <a href="#ip_325">Fig. 15</a>, which rest
upon springs <i>s s</i> at each end. The beam <i>A</i> and a similar one at
the farther end of the <i>B B</i> bars extend out to the sides of the car
truck and are suitably secured to the latter. The coils <i>w w</i> are the
ends of the field coils and the armature connections, and to these
the wires conveying the current from the trolley are connected.
The cover <i>C</i> on top of the motor at one end closes an opening
through which access to the commutator brushes is obtained. The
armature is shown at <i>H</i> in <a href="#ip_326">Fig. 16</a> and the commutator at <i>K</i> in
the same figure. Directly under the armature may be seen one
of the field magnet coils, it being marked <i>R</i>.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 16.&mdash;Railway Motor with Casing Open, showing Armature in Lower Half.</span></div></div>

<p>As will be noticed in <a href="#ip_326">Fig. 16</a>, the motor casing is made so as to
open along the central line, and the lower half is secured to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
top by means of hinges, <i>g g</i>, <a href="#ip_325">Fig. 15</a>, and also by a number of bolts,
which are not so clearly shown. The gear wheels are also located
within a casing, which (<a href="#ip_326">Fig. 16</a>) is made so as to be readily opened
whenever it becomes necessary. All the vital parts of the machine
are entirely covered, and are not easily injured by mud or
water.</p>

<p>The construction of the armature and commutator is well illustrated
in <a href="#ip_327">Fig. 17</a>, which shows this part of the machine by itself.
The armature is marked <i>A</i>, the shaft <i>B</i>, and the commutator
<i>C</i>. In the diagrams,
<a href="#ip_320">Figs. 9, 10</a>, <a href="#ip_323">11, and
12</a>, the wire coils
are represented as
wound upon the surface
of the armature
core, but, from <a href="#ip_327">Fig. 17</a>,
it will be noticed
that they are located
in grooves. A railway
motor armature core, when seen without the wire coils, looks
very much like a wide-faced cog wheel with extra long teeth,
not very well shaped for gear teeth. In <a href="#ip_327">Fig. 17</a> the ends of the
teeth are marked <i>D</i>, and the grooves within which the wire is
wound are marked <i>E</i>. The coils are not wound so that their sides
are on diametrically opposite sides of the armature core, but so
that they may be one quarter of the circumference apart, and, as
will be noticed, the wires are arranged so as to fit neatly into
each other at the ends of the armature core. The bands marked
<i>F F F F</i> are provided for the purpose of holding the wire coils
within the grooves. The flanges <i>H</i> and <i>I</i> are simply shields to
prevent oil, grease, or even water, if it should pass through the
bearings, from being thrown upon the commutator or armature.
The pinion through which the armature imparts motion to the car-wheel
axle is not shown in <a href="#ip_327">Fig. 17</a>, but it is mounted upon the taper
end of the shaft.</p>

<p>An electric railway motor is a machine that is characterized by
extreme simplicity (there being only one moving part), compactness,
and great strength. In addition, as none of the working parts is exposed
it can not be injured, no matter how much mud may accumulate
upon it. One of the reasons why the electric railway motor has
met with such unparalleled success is that it is a machine that can
withstand the roughest kind of usage without being damaged thereby.
Another reason is that an electric motor can, if called upon,
develop an amount of power two or three times greater than its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
full-rated capacity without injury, providing the strain is not maintained
too long. A steam engine or any other type of motor that
has ever been used for railway propulsion if loaded beyond its
capacity will come to a standstill&mdash;that is, it will be stalled&mdash;but
an electric motor can not be stalled with any strain that is likely
to be placed upon it. If the load is increased the motor will run
slower and the current will become greater, thus increasing the
pull, but the armature will continue to rotate until the current
becomes so great as to burn out the insulation. A railway motor
calculated to work up to twenty-five-horse power will have to develop
on an average about six-or seven-horse power, but if the
car runs off the track on a steep grade, and has such a heavy load
that the motor is called upon to develop one-hundred-horse power
for a few seconds, the machine will be equal to the occasion. This
result a steam, gas, or any other type of engine can not accomplish,
and it is this fact as much as anything else that has given the electric
motor the control of the street-railway field.</p>

<span class="subhead small notbold"><span class="smcap">By MARY MILLS PATRICK, Ph. D.</span>,<br />

PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE FOR GIRLS AT CONSTANTINOPLE.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">It</span> is during the latter part of the present century that a general
movement has arisen to give women their rights in business
life and in political and social affairs. It is the intention of this
article to treat of this movement, especially in its relation to education,
in Germany, where, of all civilized lands, it has had apparently
the smallest results. Progress in the direction indicated
has been, however, far greater than appears on the surface, and
the movement is slowly taking shape in a form that will gain official
recognition and support, and the way is being prepared for
scholarly attainments among the women of Germany, superior,
possibly, to those of the women of other nations.</p>

<p>There is, moreover, an ideal side to this movement in Germany
not altogether found in other lands. The motive for advanced
study is more largely joy in the study itself, and desire to supply
the spiritual needs of an idle life. In order to understand this
ideal tendency it is necessary to cast a glance backward over nearly
three hundred years.</p>

<p>Let us begin with the contest which was waged so successfully
for the development and protection of the German language, first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
against the Latin and later against the French. In this struggle
women took a prominent part, especially through membership in
the society called the “Order of the Palms,” which, before the
beginning of the Thirty Years’ War, united the strongest spirits
of Germany for this purpose. The first woman to join this society
was Sophie Elizabeth, Princess of Mecklenburg, married in
1636 to the Herzog of Braunschweig. She was followed by many
others, both of the nobility and the common people, and was named
by virtue of this leadership “The Deliverer.”</p>

<p>In the eighteenth century we have the founder of the German
theater, Caroline Neuber. In the artistic sense she was the first
director of the German stage, the first to turn the attention of the
greatest actors of her day to the ideal side of dramatic presentation.
Early in the eighteenth century women began to take up
university studies. A certain Frau von Zingler received a prize
from the University of Wittenberg for literary work, and the wife
of Professor Gottscheds entered upon a contest for a prize in poetry
with her husband.</p>

<p>We find some old verses published in Leipsic, in a book of students’
songs, in 1736, recognizing the fact that women attended
lectures in the university there, although the reference is rather
sarcastic, speaking of “beauty coming to listen in the halls of
learning.”</p>

<p>In 1754 the first woman received her degree of Doctor of Medicine
in Halle&mdash;Dorothea Christine Erxleben, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">née</i> Leborin, a
daughter of a physician, who attained to this result only after
many years of painstaking effort. With her father’s help she
studied the classics and medicine, and gradually, in spite of the
objections of his brother physicians, began to practice as a doctor
under her father’s protection. She is said to have cured her patients
<i>cito tuto</i>, <i>jucunde</i>, and in 1742 she published a book on the
right of women to study, the title of which, according to the custom
of the day, included the full table of contents. This book
passed through two editions, and enabled her to gain the attention
of Frederick II, who was persuaded to order the University of
Halle to grant her the privilege of taking her examination there.
The day arrived, and the hall was crowded for the occasion; the
candidate passed the ordeal in a brilliant manner, and took the
oath for the doctor’s degree amid a storm of applause from the
listeners present.</p>

<p>In the present century the germ of the movement for educational
rights for women came into consciousness in Germany in
the stormy year 1848, and first found expression and life through
the work of two women&mdash;Louise Otto Peters and Auguste Schmidt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
The former founded the Universal Association for Women in Germany,
and through this society both these women worked for thirty
years and did much toward preparing the way for the broader
efforts of the present time.</p>

<p>It is a fact granted by all the educational world that scholarship
attains a depth and thoroughness in Germany not found in
other lands, and this very perfection has been in part the cause of
the backwardness of the educational movement among the women,
for a high degree of scholarship has often been acquired by the men
at the expense of the devoted service of the women connected with
them. Yet when the women of Germany demand their educational
rights it will be to share also in the rich intellectual inheritance
of their land.</p>

<p>The majority of the men thus far regard the movement with
distrust and suspicion, but are powerless to crush it out. An amusing
instance occurred last year in the family of an official in one
of the large university towns. He was a conservative man who
had his immediate family in a proper state of subjection, but his
mother-in-law, alas! he could not control, and to his dismay she
enrolled herself at the university as a <i>Hospitant</i>, and, in spite of
the protestations of her son-in-law, she was a regular attendant
upon the courses of lectures that she had elected.</p>

<p>The regular schools for girls in Germany, above the common
schools attended by girls and boys together, are of two grades&mdash;the
middle schools and the high schools. The avowed object of
these schools is to fit girls for society and for the position of
housewife, as Herr Dr. Bosse, the Minister of Public Instruction
for the German Empire, states in his report on the condition
of girls’ schools in Germany, and as he publicly declared before
the German Parliament in the discussion regarding the establishment
of a girls’ gymnasium in Breslau, referred to later on in
this paper.</p>

<p>The girls’ schools established by the Government provide well
for the study of the modern languages, and it is the exception to
find women in the upper classes who do not speak French and English.
Literature, religion, gymnastics, and needlework are also
well taught. The course of study in the high school includes a
little mathematics, offered under the name of reckoning, and sufficient
to enable a woman to keep the accounts of a household, and
also a little science of the kind that can be learned without a knowledge
of mathematics. Let me quote a paragraph from the report
of the Minister of Public Instruction for the year 1898 in regard
to the aim of the mathematical course in the girls’ high schools:
“Accuracy in reckoning with numbers and the ability to use numbers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
in the common relations of life, especially in housekeeping.
Great weight is laid upon quick mental computations, but in all
grades the choice of problems should be such as especially apply
to the keeping of a house.” This is the opportunity which is
offered to girls by the Government in the department of mathematics!
In addition to the two grades of schools mentioned there
are seminaries in many of the large cities for the purpose of educating
women teachers. The instructors in these seminaries are
well prepared for their positions, are mostly men, and the instruction
given is very superior to that given in the girls’ high schools.
Latin and Greek are, however, not studied in these seminaries, and
mathematics and science are expurgated, we might say, of points
that might prove difficult for the feminine intellect.</p>

<p>The ability to learn Latin and Greek seems in the German mind
to especially mark the dividing line between the masculine and
feminine brain. The writer was at one time studying a subject
in Greek philosophy, in the City Library of Munich, requiring the
use of a number of Greek and Latin books, and it was amusing to
notice the astonishment of the men present that a woman should
know the classic languages!</p>

<p>The women who hold certificates from the seminaries are allowed,
according to a new law passed in 1894, to continue their
studies and to take the higher teachers’ examinations. This is
considered a great step in advance, for a woman who has successfully
passed this latter examination can hold any position in the
girls’ schools, and can even be director of such a school.</p>

<p>That German women have long been discontented with the
education provided for them by the Government is proved by the
fact that the number of higher institutions offering private opportunities
to girls is constantly increasing. As far back as 1868 the
Victoria Lyceum was founded by a Scotch woman&mdash;Miss Georgina
Archer&mdash;at her own expense and on her own responsibility, and
this institution was well sustained from the beginning. It is now
under the patronage of the Empress Frederick, and offers courses
to women that run parallel to a certain extent with those given
on the same subjects in the university. Professors from the university
lecture in the Victoria Lyceum, but a young woman who
had listened to the same professor in both places informed me that
he (perhaps unconsciously) simplified his lectures very much for
the Victoria Lyceum. Fraulein Anna von Cotta is the director
of the institution. Among the women who teach there we note
the name of the well-known Fraulein Lange, who lectures on psychology
and German literature.</p>

<p>There are several girls’ gymnasia in Germany which testify to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
the demand for higher education. These institutions are all but
one private, and three of them&mdash;one in Leipsic, one in Berlin, and
a third, opened in October, 1898, in Königsberg&mdash;are called “gymnasial
courses,” and are for girls who have finished the girls’ high
school, and who must pass entrance examinations in order to be
received into them.</p>

<p>There has been for some time a girls’ gymnasium which corresponds
exactly to those for boys in Carlsruhe, under the auspices
of the “Society for Reform in the Education of Women,” which
receives girls of twelve who must have finished the six lower
classes of a girls’ school. This society, to which the girls of Germany
owe much, is planning to open another gymnasium in Hannover,
to which girls will be received from the junior class of the
girls’ high school; the course of study will occupy five years, and
will fit girls for the same official examinations as the boys’ gymnasia.
The language courses in the highest class will be elective, providing
either for Greek or the modern languages, but Latin is obligatory
in all the classes. The girls from all these gymnasia are
debarred from taking any of the official examinations for which
their studies have prepared them.</p>

<p>The next step in the matter of gymnasial education for girls
was what might have been expected. The people of the wide-awake
city of Breslau voted, by an overwhelming majority, to
establish a girls’ gymnasium under the same laws and furnishing the
same advantages as the boys’ gymnasia. The completed plan
was sent to the Minister of Public Instruction in Berlin in January,
1898, for approval, with the intention of opening the gymnasium
at Easter, for which twenty-six girls were already enrolled.
Herr Dr. Bosse, however, foreseeing the results such an undertaking
would involve, consulted the other departments of the ministry,
and two months later a decided refusal came like a thunderbolt
upon the people of Breslau. On the 30th of April, 1898,
Herr Dr. Bosse was called to account in the Reichstag for his action
in the matter, which he justified on the ground that Government
approval of girls’ gymnasia would mean the acceptance of the
diploma for matriculation in the universities and the opening to
women of all Government professional examinations, and that to
have granted it would have been to take a step in the direction
of the modern movement for women which could never have been
recalled, and would open the lecture rooms of Germany in general
to women. He contended, further, that the founding of official
gymnasia for girls would delegate the existing girls’ high
school to a secondary place, an institution which had been planned
thoughtfully by the Government for the purpose of educating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
women in the best manner, not to become rivals of men, but help-meets
and able housekeepers.</p>

<p>The demand of the people of Breslau, Dr. Bosse said, was an
unnatural one, and his refusal was founded on the fear that such
a movement would increase and threaten the social foundations
of all Germany, as the idea that women can compete with men in
all careers is a false one.</p>

<p>The petition of the magistrate of Breslau was supported in the
discussion by some of the national-liberal, free-conservative, and
Polish representatives. These took the broad ground that girls
have a right to equal education with boys, and that the educational
institutions of Germany which have so long stood at the head of
those of the world should not, in the matter of education of women,
leave the question to be decided according to the whims of private
individuals.</p>

<p>Some of the arguments of those who spoke in favor of the
enterprise were amusing. One said that the girls of Germany
would be grateful if the Minister of Public Instruction would furnish
them with husbands, but, as there were not enough to go
around, the others should have some career provided for them.
Another, that about forty per cent of the girls of the higher classes
no longer marry, and they should not be allowed to suffer the consequences
of the fact that young men of the present day do not
care to marry, but they have a right that the way be shown them
to such careers as are suited to their feminine nature.</p>

<p>An objector said that he could not understand how any man
of pedagogical culture could approve of a girls’ gymnasium, for it
is evident that any such progress for women as that would imply
must be at the expense of the men, who would gain less on account
of the increased number of candidates for work of all kinds and
would more seldom be able to offer the best of all existences to a
woman&mdash;that of wifehood. The city of Breslau was obliged, therefore,
to give up the undertaking for the present, but the agitation
of the question has probably prepared the way for more extended
plans in the future in the same direction in Prussia.</p>

<p>A similar undertaking in Carlsruhe, in Baden, has met with
better success, and resulted in the opening of the first official gymnasium
for girls in Germany, in September, 1898. This gymnasium
was planned about the same time as that of Breslau, and as
the permission of the Minister of Public Instruction in Baden was
obtained without difficulty, the institution came into existence according
to the will of the people of Carlsruhe. Seventy-nine of
the members of the Bürgerauschuss voted in favor of the undertaking
in the meeting in which the final action was taken early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
in the summer of 1898. The Christian-conservative party only
decidedly opposed it. The leader of this party was very much
excited over the matter, and called out, when the action was taken,
“I ask you, gentlemen, on your honor, if any of you would marry
a girl from a gymnasium?”</p>

<p>The opening of the Government gymnasium will remove the
necessity for continuing the private one in Carlsruhe, under the
society in charge of it, and leave that society free to direct its
efforts elsewhere.</p>

<p>There had already been several references to the general subject
of the education of women in the Reichstag before the question
of the gymnasium in Breslau came up. In January, 1898,
Prince Carolath spoke in favor of founding several girls’ gymnasia,
and admitting women legally to the universities and to pedagogical
and to medical state professional examinations, remarking that in
all other civilized lands the universities are more open to women
than in Germany.</p>

<p>Coming now to the present attitude of the universities to the
higher education of women, we find that a great change has taken
place during the last few years. While it is still the fact that
no German woman can matriculate in any university in Germany,
yet the problem of the stand which the universities should take
is working out its own solution in the right direction.</p>

<p>The University of Berlin, the largest and in many respects the
leading one, has made progress in the matter, although women still
work there under great limitations. The cause was injured at
the outset in Berlin by the fact that women, often foreigners, who
had not the required preparation, rushed into lecture rooms which
were open to them from motives of curiosity. This caused such
strong feeling among the professors that in one instance a professor,
on entering his classroom, saw a lady sitting in the rear,
walked up to her, offered her his arm, and led her out of the room.</p>

<p>The first step in the right direction has been to demand either
a diploma from some well-known institution, or, as that could
not be complied with by German women, the certificate of the
teachers’ examinations. The possessors of such credentials may
attend lectures in any course, where the professor is willing, as
<i>Hospitants</i>. The conditions under which women may attend the
University of Berlin are the following:</p>

<p>1. A written permission must be obtained from the curator of
the university on presentation of a satisfactory diploma, a passport,
and, by Russian applicants, a written permission from the
police authorities to study in Germany.</p>

<p>2. Written permission from the rector.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
3. Written permission from the professors or docents whose
lectures the applicant wishes to attend.</p>

<p>4. The permission from the rector must be obtained each semester,
but from the curator only when a new subject is chosen.</p>

<p>5. The same fee is demanded from women as from men, and
women are requested to always carry with them, in attending lectures,
the written permission from the rector.</p>

<p>At the public installation of Rector Waldeyer, in October,
1898, both in his address and in that of the resigning rector, Geheimrath
Professor Schmoller, the subject of education of women
received attention.</p>

<p>Geheimrath Schmoller said that the first condition of further
concessions in the matter must be better preparation on the part
of the women, and when this deficiency should be provided for the
faculty of the university could make the conditions of their attending
lectures lighter, perhaps even the same as those for men. Geheimrath
Waldeyer made the subject one of three to which he
gave equal space, and which he said called for immediate attention
in the educational affairs of Germany. The other two subjects
were the relation of technical schools to the universities, and
university extension. Geheimrath Waldeyer said that he had formerly
been opposed to the higher education of women, but had
been led to change his mind from seeing that the movement is not
an artificial one, but rather the natural result of the present social
condition of society, and on the simple ground of right should be
forwarded in a legitimate manner. He spoke strongly, however,
in favor of the establishment of separate universities for men and
women, on account of the natural differences in the working of
their minds and the necessity of adapting methods in both instances
to their needs.</p>

<p>The number of women in the University of Berlin has increased
very rapidly, being in the autumn of 1896 thirty-nine, in the winter
of the same year ninety-five. The next year the largest number
was nearly two hundred, and in 1897&ndash;’98 three hundred and
fifty-two were in all inscribed. Nearly half of these were German
women. Most of the women in the University of Berlin are in
the department of philosophy, but several are pursuing courses in
theology and law. These women are of all ages. One from Charlottenburg
was sixty-two years old, and, besides this honored lady,
there were five others whose white hair testified to an age of from
fifty to fifty-five, while the youngest of all was a Bulgarian girl
of seventeen.</p>

<p>The first woman to take her degree in the University of Berlin
was Dr. Else Neumann, in December, 1898, in physics and mathematics,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
who succeeded, notwithstanding the difficulties to be contended
with in the absence of preparatory study and the necessity
for private preparation.</p>

<p>It is not, however, only in Berlin that the desire for university
study has taken a strong hold on the German women, but it is
shown in other places, not simply by the fact that many of them
attend the universities of Switzerland, which are everywhere open
to them, but by their also obtaining the advantages in their own
land which have so long been denied them.</p>

<p>Heidelberg was the first university in Germany to grant the
doctor examination to women, and this was done several years
before lectures were open to them. The writer called upon Prof.
Kuno Fischer one day in the summer of 1890 to ask permission to
attend a lecture which he was to give that afternoon on Helmholtz.
He said that he was very sorry indeed, but he was obliged
to refuse women the privilege of listening to him, as they were not
admitted to the university. I asked when they would probably
be admitted, and he replied, speaking in French, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Jamais, mademoiselle,
jamais!</i>” Four years later, however, a friend of mine
took her degree there in the department of philosophy, thus proving
that the wisest of men sometimes make mistakes.</p>

<p>Women have for years studied as <i>Hospitants</i> in the Universities
of Leipsic and Göttingen, but since November, 1897, the conditions
of their admission in Göttingen have been made more
difficult.</p>

<p>In Kiel the professors who are not willing to allow women to
attend their lectures put a star opposite their names in the university
programme of the lecture courses, and this star is unfortunately
seen opposite the names of all the professors of theology
and many of those of medicine. Women began to attend the University
of Tübingen in the autumn of 1898, Dr. Maria Gräfin von
Linden being the first, who was soon followed by many others.</p>

<p>The degree of Doctor of Philosophy <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">honoris causa</i> has been
conferred on two women by the University of Munich&mdash;in December,
1897, on the Princess Theresa, and in October, 1898, on Lady
Blennerhassett, an author, for her researches in modern languages.
The Dean of the Philosophical Faculty, accompanied by three professors,
visited her in her home in Munich to communicate to her
the honor which she had received.</p>

<p>The University of Breslau offers better conditions to women
than are provided elsewhere, as might naturally be expected, especially
in the department of medicine.</p>

<p>Germany was represented in the International Council of
Women, held in London in June of this present year, by Frau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
Anna Simson, Frau Bieber Boehm, and Fran Marie Stritt, of
Dresden.</p>

<p>It was also decided at this congress that the next Quinquennial
International Council of Women should be held in Berlin,
and it will without doubt be an occasion that will mark an era in
the history of the progress of liberty for the women of Germany.</p>

<h2 title="SCENES ON THE PLANETS" id="scenes">SCENES ON THE PLANETS.<br />

<span class="subhead small notbold"><span class="smcap">By GARRETT P. SERVISS.</span></span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap1">Although</span> amateurs have played a conspicuous part in telescopic
discovery among the heavenly bodies, yet every owner
of a small telescope should not expect to attach his name to a star.
But he certainly can do something perhaps more useful to himself
and his friends. He can follow the discoveries that others, with
better appliances and opportunities, have made, and can thus impart
to those discoveries that sense of reality which only comes
from seeing things with one’s own eyes. There are hundreds of
things continually referred to in books and writings on astronomy
which have but a misty and uncertain significance for the mere
reader, but which he can easily verify for himself with the aid of
a telescope of four or five inches’ aperture, and which, when actually
confronted by the senses, assume a meaning, a beauty, and
an importance that would otherwise entirely have escaped him.
Henceforth every allusion to the objects he has seen is eloquent
with intelligence and suggestion.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, the planets that have been the subject of
so many observations and speculations of late years&mdash;Mars, Jupiter,
Saturn, Venus. For the ordinary reader much that is said
about them makes very little impression upon his mind, and is
almost unintelligible. He reads of the “snow patches” on Mars,
but unless he has actually seen the whitened poles of that planet
he can form no clear image in his mind of what is meant. So the
“belts of Jupiter” is a confusing and misleading phrase for almost
everybody except the astronomer, and the rings of Saturn are beyond
comprehension unless they have actually been seen.</p>

<p>It is true that pictures and photographs partially supply the
place of observation, but by no means so successfully as many
imagine. The most realistic drawings and the sharpest photographs
in astronomy are those of the moon, yet I think nobody
would maintain that any picture in existence is capable of imparting
a really satisfactory visual impression of the appearance of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
lunar globe. Nobody who has not seen the moon with a telescope&mdash;it
need not be a large one&mdash;can form a correct and definite idea
of what the moon is like.</p>

<p>The satisfaction of viewing with one’s own eyes some of the
things the astronomers write and talk about is very great, and the
illumination that comes from such viewing is equally great. Just
as in foreign travel the actual seeing of a famous city, a great gallery
filled with masterpieces, or a battlefield where decisive issues
have been fought out illuminates, for the traveler’s mind, the
events of history, the criticisms of artists, and the occurrences of
contemporary life in foreign lands, so an acquaintance with the
sights of the heavens gives a
grasp on astronomical problems
that can not be acquired
in any other way.
The person who has been in
Rome, though he may be no
archæologist, gets a far more
vivid conception of a new
discovery in the Forum than
does the reader who has
never seen the city of the
Seven Hills; and the amateur
who has looked at Jupiter
with a telescope, though
he may be no astronomer,
finds that the announcement
of some change among the
wonderful belts of that cloudy planet has for him a meaning and
an interest in which the ordinary reader can not share.</p>

<div id="ip_338" class="figleft" style="width: 313px;">
  <img src="images/illo_052.jpg" width="313" height="314" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Jupiter seen with a Five-Inch Telescope.</span>
<span class="notbold">Shadow of a satellite visible.</span></div></div>

<p>Jupiter is perhaps the easiest of all the planets for the amateur
observer. A three-inch telescope gives beautiful views of the
great planet, although a four-inch or a five-inch is of course better.
But there is no necessity for going beyond six inches’ aperture in
any case. For myself, I think I should care for nothing better
than my five-inch of fifty-two inches’ focal distance. With such
a glass more details are visible in the dark belts and along the
bright equatorial girdle than can be correctly represented in a
sketch before the rotation of the planet has altered their aspect,
while the shadows of the satellites thrown upon the broad disk,
and the satellites themselves when in transit, can be seen sometimes
with exquisite clearness. The contrasting colors of various
parts of the disk are also easily studied with a glass of four or five
inches’ aperture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
There is a charm about the great planet when he rides high in
a clear evening sky, lording it over the fixed stars with his serene,
unflickering luminousness, which no possessor of a telescope can
resist. You turn the glass upon him and he floats into the field
of view, with his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cortége</i> of satellites, like a yellow-and-red moon,
attended by four miniatures of itself. You instantly comprehend
Jupiter’s mastery over his satellites&mdash;their allegiance is evident.
No one would for an instant mistake them for stars accidentally
seen in the same field of view. Although it requires a very large
telescope to magnify their disks to measurable dimensions, yet the
smallest glass differentiates them at once from the fixed stars.
There is something almost startling in their appearance of companionship
with the huge planet&mdash;this sudden verification to your
eyes of the laws of gravitation and of central forces. It is easy,
while looking at Jupiter amid his family, to understand the consternation
of the churchmen when Galileo’s telescope revealed that
miniature of the solar system, and it is gratifying to gaze upon one
of the first battle grounds whereon science gained a decisive victory
for truth.</p>

<p>The swift changing of place among the satellites, as well as the
rapidity of Jupiter’s axial rotation, give the attraction of visible
movement to the Jovian spectacle. The planet rotates in four
or five minutes less than ten hours&mdash;in other words, it makes two
turns and four tenths of a third turn while the earth is turning
once upon its axis. A point on Jupiter’s equator moves about
twenty-seven thousand miles, or considerably more than the entire
circumference of the earth, in a single hour. The effect of
this motion is clearly perceptible to the observer with a telescope
on account of the diversified markings and colors of the moving
disk, and to watch it is one of the greatest pleasures that the telescope
affords.</p>

<p>It would be possible, when the planet is favorably situated, to
witness an entire rotation of Jupiter in the course of one night,
but the beginning and end of the observation would be more or
less interfered with by the effects of low altitude, to say nothing
of the tedium of so long a vigil. But by looking at the planet
for an hour at a time in the course of a few nights every side of
it will have been presented to view. Suppose the first observation
is made between nine and ten o’clock on any night which may have
been selected. Then on the following night between ten and
eleven o’clock Jupiter will have made two and a half turns
upon his axis, and the side diametrically opposite to that seen
on the first night will be visible. On the third night between
eleven and twelve o’clock Jupiter will have performed five complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
rotations, and the side originally viewed will be visible
again.</p>

<div id="ip_340" class="figcenter" style="width: 506px;">

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Eclipses and Transits of Jupiter’s Satellites.</span> <span class="notbold">Satellite I and the shadow of III are
seen in transit. IV is about to be eclipsed.</span></div></div>

<p>Owing to the rotundity of the planet, only the central part of
the disk is sharply defined, and markings which can be easily seen
when centrally located become indistinct or disappear altogether
when near the limb. Approach to the edge of the disk also causes
a foreshortening which sometimes entirely alters the aspect of a
marking. It is advisable, therefore, to confine the attention mainly
to the middle of the disk. As time passes, clearly defined markings
on or between the cloudy belts will be seen to approach the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
western edge of the disk, gradually losing their distinctness and
altering their appearance, while from the region of indistinct definition
near the eastern edge other markings slowly emerge and
advance toward the center, becoming sharper in outline and more
clearly defined in color as they swing into view.</p>

<p>Watching these changes, the observer is carried away by the
reflection that he actually sees the turning of another distant world
upon its axis of rotation, just as he might view the revolving earth
from a standpoint on the moon. Belts of reddish clouds, many
thousands of miles across, are stretched along on each side of the
equator of the great planet he is watching; the equatorial belt
itself, brilliantly lemon-hued, or sometimes ruddy, is diversified
with white globular and balloon-shaped masses, which almost recall
the appearance of summer cloud domes hanging over a terrestrial
landscape, while toward the poles shadowy expanses of gradually
deepening blue or blue-gray suggest the comparative coolness
of those regions which lie always under a low sun.</p>

<p>After a few nights’ observation even the veriest amateur finds
himself recognizing certain shapes or appearances&mdash;a narrow dark
belt running slopingly across the equator from one of the main
cloud zones to the other, or a rift in one of the colored bands, or
a rotund white mass apparently floating above the equator, or a
broad scallop in the edge of a belt like that near the site of the
celebrated “red spot,” whose changes of color and aspect since its
first appearance in 1878, together with the light it has thrown on
the constitution of Jupiter’s disk, have all but created a new Jovian
literature, so thoroughly and so frequently have they been discussed.</p>

<p>And, having noticed these recurring features, the observer will
begin to note their relations to one another, and will thus be led
to observe that some of them gradually drift apart, while others
drift nearer; and after a time, without any aid from books or
hints from observatories, he will discover for himself that there is a
law governing the movements on Jupiter’s disk. Upon the whole
he will find that the swiftest motions are near the equator, and
the slowest near the poles, although, if he is persistent and has a
good eye and a good instrument, he will note exceptions to this
rule, probably arising, as Professor Hough suggests, from differences
of altitude in Jupiter’s atmosphere. Finally, he will conclude
that the colossal globe before him is, exteriorly at least, a vast
ball of clouds and vapors, subject to tremendous vicissitudes, possibly
intensely heated, and altogether different in its physical constitution,
although made up of similar elements, from the earth.
Then, if he chooses, he can sail off into the delightful cloud-land of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
astronomical speculation, and make of the striped and spotted
sphere of Jove just such a world as may please his fancy&mdash;for a
world of some kind it certainly is.</p>

<p>For many observers the satellites of Jupiter possess even greater
attractions than the gigantic ball itself. As I have already remarked,
their movements are very noticeable and lend a wonderful
animation to the scene. Although they bear classical names, they
are almost universally referred to by their Roman numbers, beginning
with the innermost, whose symbol is I, and running outward
in regular order II, III, and IV. The minute satellite much nearer
to the planet than any of the others, which Mr. Barnard discovered
with the Lick telescope in 1892, is called the fifth, although in the
order of distance it would be the first. In size and importance,
however, it can not rank with its comparatively gigantic brothers.
Of course, no amateur’s telescope can show the faintest glimpse
of it.</p>

<p>Satellite I, situated at a mean distance of 261,000 miles from
Jupiter’s center&mdash;about 22,000 miles farther than the moon is
from the earth&mdash;is urged by its master’s overpowering attraction
to a speed of 320 miles per minute, so that it performs a complete
revolution in about forty-two hours and a half. The others, of
course, move more slowly, but even the most distant performs
its revolution in several hours less than sixteen days. The plane
of their orbits is presented edgewise toward the earth, from which
it follows that they appear to move back and forth nearly in straight
lines, some apparently approaching the planet, while others are
receding from it. The changes in their relative positions, which
can be detected from hour to hour, are very striking night after
night, and lead to a great variety of arrangements always pleasing
to the eye.</p>

<p>The most interesting phenomena that they present are their
transits and those of their round, black shadows across the face
of the planet; their eclipses by the planet’s shadow, when they disappear
and afterward reappear with astonishing suddenness; and
their occultations by the globe of Jupiter. Upon the whole, the
most interesting thing for the amateur to watch is the passage of
the shadows across Jupiter. The distinctness with which they can
be seen when the air is steady is likely to surprise, as it is certain
to delight, the observer. When it falls upon a light part of the
disk the shadow of a satellite is as black and sharply outlined as
a drop of ink; on a dark-colored belt it can not so easily be seen.</p>

<p>It is more difficult to see the satellites themselves in transit.
There appears to be some difference among them as to visibility
in such circumstances. Owing to their luminosity they are best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
seen when they have a dark belt for a background, and are least
easily visible when they appear against a bright portion of the
planet. Every observer should provide himself with a copy of the
American Ephemeris for the current year, wherein he will find
all the information needed to enable him to identify the various
satellites and to predict, by turning Washington mean time into
his own local time, the various phenomena of the transits and
eclipses.</p>

<p>While a faithful study of the phenomena of Jupiter is likely
to lead the student to the conclusion that the greatest planet in
our system is not a suitable abode for life, yet the problem of its
future, always fascinating to the imagination, is open; and whosoever
may be disposed to record his observations in a systematic
manner may at least hope to render aid in the solution of that
problem.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Saturn seen with a Five-Inch
Telescope.</span></div></div>

<p>Saturn ranks next to Jupiter in attractiveness for the observer
with a telescope. The rings are almost as mystifying to-day as
they were in the time of Herschel. There is probably no single
telescopic view that can compare in
the power to excite wonder with that
of Saturn when the ring system is
not so widely opened but that both
poles of the planet project beyond
it. One returns to it again and again
with unflagging interest, and the
beauty of the spectacle quite matches
its singularity. When Saturn is in
view the owner of a telescope may become a recruiting officer for
astronomy by simply inviting his friends to gaze at the wonderful
planet. The silvery color of the ball, delicately chased with half-visible
shadings, merging one into another from the bright equatorial
band to the bluish polar caps; the grand arch of the rings,
sweeping across the planet with a perceptible edging of shadow;
their sudden disappearance close to the margin of the ball, where
they go behind it and fall straightway into night; the manifest
contrast of brightness, if not of color, between the two principal
rings; the fine curve of the black line marking the 1,600-mile gap
between their edges&mdash;these are some of the elements of a picture
that can never fade from the memory of any one who has once beheld
it in its full glory.</p>

<p>Saturn’s moons are by no means so interesting to watch as are
those of Jupiter. Even the effect of their surprising number
(raised to nine by Professor Pickering’s discovery last spring of a
new one which is almost at the limit of visibility, and was found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
only with the aid of photography) is lost, because most of them are
too faint to be seen with ordinary telescopes, or, if seen, to make
any notable impression upon the eye. The two largest&mdash;Titan and
Japetus&mdash;are easily found, and Titan is conspicuous, but they give
none of that sense of companionship and obedience to a central
authority which strikes even the careless observer of Jupiter’s system.
This is owing partly to their more deliberate movements
and partly to the inclination of the plane of their orbits, which
seldom lies edgewise toward the earth.</p>

<div id="ip_344" class="figcenter" style="width: 586px;">
  <img src="images/illo_058.jpg" width="586" height="586" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Polar View of Saturn’s System.</span> <span class="notbold">The orbits of the five nearest satellites are shown.
The dotted line outside the rings shows Roche’s limit.</span></div></div>

<p>But the charm of the peerless rings is abiding, and the interest
of the spectator is heightened by recalling what science has recently
established as to their composition. It is marvelous to think,
while looking upon their broad, level surfaces&mdash;as smooth, apparently,
as polished steel, though thirty thousand miles across&mdash;that
they are in reality vast circling currents of meteoritic particles or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
dust, through which run immense waves, condensation and rarefaction
succeeding one another as in the undulations of sound.
Yet, with all their inferential tumult, they may actually be as
soundless as the depths of interstellar space, for Struve has shown
that those spectacular rings possess no appreciable mass, and,
viewed from Saturn itself, their (to us) gorgeous seeming bow may
appear only as a wreath of shimmering vapor spanning the sky and
paled by the rivalry of the brighter stars.</p>

<p>In view of the theory of tidal action disrupting a satellite within
a critical distance from the center of its primary, the thoughtful
observer of Saturn will find himself wondering what may have
been the origin of the rings. The critical distance referred to, and
which is known as Roche’s limit, lies, according to the most trustworthy
estimates, just outside the outermost edge of the rings.
It follows that if the matter composing the rings were collected
into a single body that body would inevitably be torn to pieces and
scattered into rings; and so, too, if instead of one there were several
or many bodies of considerable size occupying the place of
the rings, all of these bodies would be disrupted and scattered. If
one of the present moons of Saturn&mdash;for instance, Mimas, the innermost
hitherto discovered&mdash;should wander within the magic circle
of Roche’s limit it would suffer a similar fate, and its particles
would be disseminated among the rings. One can hardly help
wondering whether the rings have originated from the demolition
of satellites&mdash;Saturn devouring his children, as the ancient myths
represent, and encircling himself, amid the fury of destruction,
with the dust of his disintegrated victims. At any rate, the amateur
student of Saturn will find in the revelations of his telescope
the inspirations of poetry as well as those of science, and the bent
of his mind will determine which he shall follow.</p>

<p>Professor Pickering’s discovery of a ninth satellite of Saturn,
situated at the great distance of nearly eight million miles from
the planet, serves to call attention to the vastness of the “sphere
of activity” over which the ringed planet reigns. Surprising as
the distance of the new satellite appears when compared with that
of our moon, it is yet far from the limit where Saturn’s control
ceases and that of the sun becomes predominant. That limit, according
to Prof. Asaph Hall’s calculation, is nearly 30,000,000 miles
from Saturn’s center, while if our moon were removed to a distance
a little exceeding 500,000 miles the earth would be in danger
of losing its satellite through the elopement of Artemis with
Apollo.</p>

<p>Although, as already remarked, the satellites of Saturn are not
especially interesting to the amateur telescopist, yet it may be well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
to mention that, in addition to Titan and Japetus, the satellite
named Rhea, the fifth in order of distance from the planet, is not a
difficult object for a three-or four-inch telescope, and two others
considerably fainter than Rhea&mdash;Dione (the fourth) and Tethys
(the third)&mdash;may be seen in favorable circumstances. The others&mdash;Mimas
(the first), Enceladus (the second), and Hyperion (the seventh)&mdash;are
beyond the reach of all but large telescopes. The ninth
satellite, which has received the name of Phœbe, is much fainter
than any of the others, its stellar magnitude being reckoned by
its discoverer at about 15.5.</p>

<p>Mars, the best advertised of all the planets, is nearly the least
satisfactory to look at except during a favorable opposition, like
those of 1877 and 1892, when its comparative nearness to the earth
renders some of its characteristic features visible in a small telescope.
The next favorable opposition will occur in 1907.</p>

<div id="ip_346" class="figleft" style="width: 306px;">
  <img src="images/illo_060.jpg" width="306" height="308" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Mars seen with a Five-Inch Telescope.</span></div></div>

<p>When well seen with an ordinary telescope, say a four-or five-inch
glass, Mars shows three peculiarities that may be called fairly
conspicuous&mdash;viz., its white polar cap, its general reddish, or orange-yellow,
hue, and its dark markings, one of the clearest of
which is the so-called Syrtis Major, or, as it was once named on
account of its shape, “Hourglass Sea.” Other dark expanses in
the southern hemisphere are
not difficult to be seen, although
their outlines are
more or less misty and indistinct.
The gradual diminution
of the polar cap, which
certainly behaves in this respect
as a mass of snow and
ice would do, is a most interesting
spectacle. As summer
advances in the southern
hemisphere of Mars, the
white circular patch surrounding
the pole becomes
smaller, night after night,
until it sometimes disappears
entirely even from the ken of the largest telescopes. At the same
time the dark expanses become more distinct, as if the melting of
the polar snows had supplied them with a greater depth of water,
or the advance of the season had darkened them with a heavier
growth of vegetation.</p>

<p>The phenomena mentioned above are about all that a small
telescope will reveal. Occasionally a dark streak, which large instruments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
show is connected with the mysterious system of “canals,”
can be detected, but the “canals” themselves are far beyond
the reach of any telescope except a few of the giants handled
by experienced observers. The conviction which seems to have
forced its way into the minds even of some conservative astronomers,
that on Mars the conditions, to use the expression of Professor
Young, “are more nearly earthlike than on any other of
the heavenly bodies which we can see with our present telescopes,”
is sufficient to make the
planet a center of undying
interest notwithstanding the
difficulties with which the
amateur is confronted in his
endeavors to see the details
of its markings.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Illumination of Venus’s Atmosphere at
the beginning of her Transit across the
Sun.</span></div></div>

<p>In Venus “the fatal gift
of beauty” may be said, as
far as our observations are
concerned, to be matched by
the equally fatal gift of
brilliance. Whether it be
due to atmospheric reflection
alone or to the prevalence
of clouds, Venus is
so bright that considerable
doubt exists as to the actual
visibility of any permanent
markings on her surface. The detailed representations of the disk
of Venus by Mr. Percival Lowell, showing in some respects a resemblance
to the stripings of Mars, can not yet be accepted as decisive.
More experienced astronomers than Mr. Lowell have been
unable to see at all things which he draws with a fearless and unhesitating
pencil. That there are some shadowy features of the
planet’s surface to be seen in favorable circumstances is probable,
but the time for drawing a “map of Venus” has not yet
come.</p>

<p>The previous work of Schiaparelli lends a certain degree of
probability to Mr. Lowell’s observations on the rotation of Venus.
This rotation, according to the original announcement of Schiaparelli,
is probably performed in the same period as the revolution
around the sun. In other words, Venus, if Schiaparelli and Lowell
are right, always presents the same side to the sun, possessing, in
consequence, a day hemisphere and a night hemisphere which never
interchange places. This condition is so antagonistic to all our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
ideas of what constitutes habitability for a planet that one hesitates
to accept it as proved, and almost hopes that it may turn out
to have no real existence. Venus, as the twin of the earth in size,
is a planet which the imagination, warmed by its sunny aspect,
would fain people with intelligent beings a little fairer than ourselves;
but how can such ideas be reconciled with the picture of a
world one half of which is subjected to the merciless rays of a
never-setting sun, while the other half is buried in the fearful
gloom and icy chill of unending night?</p>

<p>Any amateur observer who wishes to test his eyesight and his
telescope in the search of shades or markings on the disk of Venus
by the aid of which the question of its rotation may finally be settled
should do his work while the sun is still above the horizon.
Schiaparelli adopted that plan years ago, and others have followed
him with advantage. The diffused light of day serves to take off
the glare which is so serious an obstacle to the successful observation
of Venus when seen against a dark sky. Knowing the location
of Venus in the sky, which can be ascertained from the Ephemeris,
the observer can find it by day. If his telescope is not permanently
mounted and provided with “circles” this may not prove
an easy thing to do, yet a little perseverance and ingenuity will
effect it. One way is to find, with a star chart, some star whose
declination is the same, or very nearly the same, as that of Venus,
and which crosses the meridian say twelve hours ahead of her.
Then set the telescope upon that star, when it is on the meridian
at night, and leave it there, and the next day, twelve hours after
the star crossed the meridian, look into your telescope and you will
see Venus, or, if not, a slight motion of the tube one way or another
will bring her into view.</p>

<p>For many amateurs the phases of Venus will alone supply sufficient
interest for telescopic observation. The changes in her form,
from that of a round full moon when she is near superior conjunction
to the gibbous, and finally the half-moon phase as she approaches
her eastern elongation, followed by the gradually narrowing
and lengthening crescent, until she becomes a mere silver
sickle as she swings in between the sun and the earth, form a succession
of delightful pictures for the eye.</p>

<p>Not very much can be said for Mercury as a telescopic object.
The little planet presents phases like those of Venus, and, according
to Schiaparelli and Lowell, it resembles Venus in its rotation,
keeping always the same side to the sun. In fact, Schiaparelli’s
discovery of this peculiarity in the case of Mercury preceded the
similar discovery in the case of Venus. There are perceptible
markings on Mercury which have reminded some astronomers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
the appearance of the moon, and there are various reasons for
thinking that the planet can not be a suitable abode for living
beings, at least for beings resembling the inhabitants of the earth.
Uranus and Neptune are too far away to present any attraction for
amateur observation.</p>

<h2 id="professor">PROFESSOR WARD ON “NATURALISM AND AGNOSTICISM.”<br />

<span class="subhead small notbold"><span class="smcap">By</span> HERBERT SPENCER.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">In</span> a recent advertisement, Professor Ward’s work entitled as
above was characterized as “one of the most important contributions
to philosophy made in our time in England,” and this was
joined with the prophecy that it “may even do something to restore
to philosophy the prominent place it once occupied in English
thought.” Along with laudatory expressions, I have observed in
some notices reprobation of the manner adopted by Professor
Ward in his attack upon my views&mdash;I might almost say upon me;
and one of the reviewers gives examples of the words he uses&mdash;“ridiculous,”
“absurd,” “blunder,” “nonsense,” “amazing fallacy,”
“our oracle.”</p>

<p>When, some time ago, I glanced at one of the volumes, I came
upon a passage which at once stamped the book by displaying the
attitude of the writer; but, being then otherwise occupied, I decided
not to disturb myself by reading more. Now, however,
partly by the reviews I have seen, and partly by the comments of
a friend, I have been shown that I can not let the book pass without
remark. The assumption that a critic states rightly the doctrine
he criticises is so generally made, that in the absence of proof
to the contrary his criticisms are almost certain to be regarded as
valid. And when the critic is a Cambridge Professor and an Honorary
LL. D., the assumption will be thought fully warranted.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Let me set out by quoting some passages disclosing the kind of
feeling by which Professor Ward’s criticisms are influenced, if not
prompted. In his preface he <span class="locked">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“When at length Naturalism is forced to take account of the facts of
life and mind, we find the strain on the mechanical theory is more than
it will bear. Mr. Spencer has blandly to confess that ‘two volumes’ of
his <i>Synthetic Philosophy</i> are missing, the volumes that should connect
inorganic with biological, evolution.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Respecting the first of these sentences, I have only to remark
that I have said (as in <i>First Principles</i>, § 62) and repeatedly implied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
that force or energy in the sense which a “mechanical theory”
connotes, can not be that Ultimate Cause whence all things
proceed, and that there is as much warrant for calling it spiritual
as for calling it material. As was asserted at the close of that work
(p. 558), the “implications are no more materialistic than they are
spiritualistic; and no more spiritualistic than they are materialistic”;
and as was contended in the <i>Principles of Sociology</i>, § 659,
“the Power manifested throughout the Universe distinguished as
material, is the same Power which in ourselves wells up under the
form of consciousness.”</p>

<p>But it is to the second sentence I here chiefly draw attention.
Whether or not there be a sarcasm behind the words “blandly to
confess,” it is clear that the sentence is meant to imply some dereliction
on my part. Now in the programme of the Synthetic Philosophy,
the division dealing with inorganic nature was avowedly
omitted, “because even without it the scheme is too extensive”;
and this undue extensiveness was so conspicuous that I was thought
absurd or almost insane. Yet I am now tacitly reproached because
I did not make it more extensive still&mdash;because an undertaking
deemed scarcely possible was not made quite impossible.
When blamed for attempting too much, it never entered my
thoughts that I might in after years be blamed for not attempting
more.</p>

<p>Repeated reference to <i>First Principles</i> as “the stereotyped philosophy”
are manifestly intended by Professor Ward to reflect on
me, either for having left that work during many years unchanged,
or for implying that no change is needed. Much as I dislike personal
explanations, I am here compelled to make them. If, in 1896,
when the ten volumes constituting the Synthetic Philosophy were
completed, I had done nothing toward revision of them, the omission
would not have been considered by most men a reason for complaint.
The facts, however, are, that in 1867 I issued a recast
and revised edition of <i>First Principles</i>; in 1870 an edition of the
<i>Principles of Psychology</i>, of which half was revised, and ten years
later an enlarged edition of the same work; in 1885 a revised edition
of the first volume of the <i>Principles of Sociology</i>; and now I
have fortunately been able to finish a revised and enlarged edition
of the <i>Principles of Biology</i>. Any one not willfully blind might
have seen that when persisting, under great difficulties, in trying to
execute the entire work as originally outlined, it was not practicable
at the same time to bring all earlier parts of it up to
date. Professor Ward, however, thinks that I should have sacrificed
the end to improve the beginning, or else that I should
have found energy enough to re-revise an earlier volume while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
writing the later ones; and my failure to do both prompts sarcastic

<p class="in0"><a name="Footnote_A" id="Footnote_A" href="#FNanchor_A" class="fnanchor">A</a> Candor often brings penalties, as witness the announcement “stereotyped edition.”
When another thousand of a work has been ordered, the printers do not always refer to the
author for correction of the title-page, but, as a matter of course, put “second edition,” or
“third edition,” as the case may be. When my attention has been drawn to such matters,
however, I have directed that the words “stereotyped edition” shall be put on the title-page
if the printing is from plates, and if the work is unaltered: objecting to a usage which
betrays readers into the false belief that new matter is forthcoming. I did not perceive
that an antagonist might transform the words “stereotyped edition” into an assertion that
the work needed no changes. Experience should have warned me that adverse interpretations
are inevitable wherever they are possible. To the question&mdash;“Why did you stereotype?”
the obvious reply is&mdash;“From motives of economy.”</p></div>

<p>In further illustration of the feeling Professor Ward brings to
his task, I may quote the following passage, in which he interposes
comments on my mode of <span class="locked">writing:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“By the persistence of Force [capital F], we really mean the persistence
of some Power [capital P] which transcends our knowledge and conception.
The manifestations, as recurring either in ourselves or outside
of us, do not persist; but that which persists is the Unknown Cause
[capitals again] of these manifestations.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">The matter itself is trivial enough. It is worth noticing only as
indicating a state of mind. Supposing even that capitals were in
such cases inappropriate&mdash;supposing even that small initial letters
would have been more appropriate; it is clear that only one having
a strong <i>animus</i> would have gone out of his way to notice it.</p>

<p>After thus enabling the reader to judge in what temper the
criticisms of Professor Ward are made, I may pass on.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>As implied at the outset, my intention is not to discuss Professor
Ward’s own philosophy&mdash;the less so because I discussed a like
philosophy nearly a generation ago. His position is that “Once
materialism is abandoned and dualism found untenable, a spiritualistic
monism remains the one stable position. It is only in terms of
mind that we can understand the unity, activity, and regularity that
nature presents. In so understanding we see that Nature is Spirit.”
(<i>Preface.</i>) This was the position of Dr. Martineau in 1872 (and
probably is now). He argued, that to account for this infinitude
of physical changes everywhere going on, “Mind must be conceived
as there,” “under the guise of simple Dynamics.” My
criticisms on this view, given in an essay entitled “Mr. Martineau
on Evolution,” can not here be repeated. But I held then, as I
hold now, that “the Ultimate Power is no more representable in
terms of human consciousness than human consciousness is representable
in terms of a plant’s functions.” Briefly the result is, that
in saying “Nature is Spirit” (capital N and capital S!), Professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
Ward implies that he knows all about it; while I, on the other
hand, am sure that I know nothing about it.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>And now, passing to my essential purpose, let me exemplify
Professor Ward’s controversial method. Specifying an hypothesis
of the late Dr. Croll (who, he thinks, had “incomparably more
right to an opinion on the question” than I have), he says, that
it “at least recognizes a problem with which Mr. Spencer scarcely
attempts to deal&mdash;I mean the evolution of the chemical elements.
It thus suffices to convict Mr. Spencer’s work of a certain incompleteness”
(i., 190). Apparently the words “scarcely attempts”
refer to a passage in the above-named essay, “Mr. Martineau on
Evolution,” where several reasons are given for thinking that the
“so-called elements arise by compounding and recompounding.”
More than this has been done, however. The evolution of the elements,
if not systematically dealt with within the limits of the
Synthetic Philosophy, has not been ignored. In an essay on “The
Nebular Hypothesis” (<i>Essays</i>, i., pp. 156&ndash;9), it is argued, that
“the general law of evolution, if it does not actually involve the
conclusion that the so-called elements are compounds, yet affords
<i>a priori</i> ground for suspecting that they are such”; and five groups
of traits are enumerated which support the belief that they originated
by a process of evolution like that everywhere going on.
But the point I here chiefly emphasize is that, having reflected
upon me for omitting two volumes, Professor Ward again reflects
upon me for having omitted something which one of these volumes
would have contained. “Sir, you have neglected to build that house
which was wanted! Moreover, you have not supplied the stairs!”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>From a sin of omission let us pass to a sin of commission. Professor
Ward quotes from me the sentence&mdash;“The absolutely homogeneous
must lose its equilibrium; and the relatively homogeneous
must lapse into the relatively less homogeneous.”&mdash;<i>First Principles</i>,
p. 429. Then presently he <span class="locked">writes:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“In truth, however, homogeneity is not necessarily instability. Quite
otherwise. If the homogeneity be absolute&mdash;that of Lord Kelvin’s primordial
medium, say&mdash;the stability will be absolute too. In other words,
if ‘the indefinite, incoherent homogeneity,’ in which, according to Mr.
Spencer, some rearrangement <i>must result</i>, be a state devoid of all qualitative
diversity and without assignable bounds, then, as we saw in discussing
mechanical ideals, any ‘rearrangement’ can result only from
external interference; it can not begin from within” (i., 223).</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">And then he goes on to argue that “Thus, the very first step in
Mr. Spencer’s evolution seems to necessitate a breach of continuity.
This fatal defect, &amp;c.” (<i>ibid.</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
Observe the words “without assignable bounds”&mdash;without
knowable limits, infinite. So that the law of the instability of the
homogeneous is disposed of because it does not apply to an infinite
homogeneous medium. But since infinity is inconceivable by us,
this alleged case of stable homogeneity is inconceivable too. Hence
the proposal is to shelve the law displayed in all things we know,
because it is inapplicable to a hypothetical thing we can not know,
and can not even conceive! Now let me turn to the essential point.
This nominally-exceptional case was fully recognized by me in the
chapter he is criticising. In § 155 of <i>First Principles</i> (p. 429), it
is <span class="locked">written:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“One stable homogeneity only, is hypothetically possible. If centers
of force, absolutely uniform in their powers, were diffused with absolute
uniformity through unlimited space, they would remain in equilibrium.
This, however, though a verbally intelligible supposition, is one that can
not be represented in thought; since unlimited space is inconceivable.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">So that this nominal exception which Professor Ward urges against
me as a “fatal defect,” was set forth by me thirty-seven years ago!</p>

<p>A somewhat more involved case may next be dealt with. Professor
Ward <span class="locked">writes:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Moreover, on the physical assumption from which Mr. Spencer sets
out, viz., that the mass of the universe and the energy of the universe
are fixed in quantity&mdash;which ought to mean are finite in quantity&mdash;there
can be no such alternations [of evolution and dissolution] as he
supposes” (i., 192).</p></blockquote>

<p>After some two pages of argument, he goes <span class="locked">on:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“And so while all transformations of energy lead directly or indirectly
to transformation into heat, from that transformation there is no
complete return, and, therefore finally no return at all. This then is the
conclusion to which Mr. Spencer’s premises lead. Two eminent physicists
who accept those premises may be cited at this point: ‘It is absolutely
certain,’ they say, ‘that life, so far as it is physical, depends essentially
upon transformations of energy; it is also absolutely certain that
age after age the possibility of such transformations is becoming less and
less; and, so far as we yet know, the final state of the present universe
must be an aggregation (into one mass) of all the matter it contains, <i>i. e.</i>
the potential energy gone, and a practically useless state of kinetic energy,
<i>i. e.</i> uniform temperature throughout that mass.... The present
visible universe began in time and will in time come to an end’” (p. 194).</p></blockquote>

<p>Mark now, however, that this opinion of “two eminent physicists,”
quoted to disprove my position, and tacitly assumed to have
validity in so far as it serves that end, is forthwith dismissed as having,
for other purposes, no validity. His next paragraph <span class="locked">runs:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“To this conclusion we are surely led from such premises. But again
I ask what warrant is there for the premises? Our experience certainly
does not embrace the totality of things, is, in fact, ridiculously far from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
it. We have no evidence of definite space or time limits; quite the contrary.
Every advance of knowledge only opens up new vistas into a
remoter past and discloses further depths of immensity teeming with
worlds.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus the truth urged against me is that we can not know anything
about these ultimate physical principles in their application
to the ultra-visible universe. But, unhappily for Professor Ward’s
criticism, I entered this same caveat long ago. Demurring to that
doctrine of the dissipation of energy to which he now demurs, I
<span class="locked">wrote:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Here, indeed, we arrive at a barrier to our reasonings; since we can
not know whether this condition is or is not fulfilled. If the ether which
fills the interspaces of our Sidereal system has a limit somewhere beyond
the outermost stars, then it is inferable that motion is not lost by radiation
beyond this limit; and if so, the original degree of diffusion may
be resumed. Or supposing the ethereal medium to have no such limit,
yet, on the hypothesis of an unlimited space, containing, at certain intervals,
Sidereal Systems like our own, it may be that the quantity of molecular
motion radiated into the region occupied by our Sidereal System,
is equal to that which our Sidereal System radiates; in which case the
quantity of motion possessed by it, remaining undiminished, it may continue
during unlimited time its alternate concentrations and diffusions.
But if, on the other hand, throughout boundless space filled with ether,
there exist no other Sidereal Systems subject to like changes, or if such
other Sidereal Systems exist at more than a certain average distance
from one another; then it seems an unavoidable conclusion that the quantity
of motion possessed, must diminish by radiation; and that so, on
each successive resumption of the nebulous form, the matter of our
Sidereal System will occupy a less space; until it reaches either a state in
which its concentrations and diffusions are relatively small, or a state
of complete aggregation and rest. Since, however, we have no evidence
showing the existence or non-existence of Sidereal Systems throughout
remote space; and since, even had we such evidence, a legitimate conclusion
could not be drawn from premises of which one element (unlimited
space) is inconceivable; we must be forever without answer to this transcendent
question.” (<i>First Principles</i>, § 182, pp. 535&ndash;6.)</p></blockquote>

<p>See, then, how the case stands. After urging against me the
argument of “two eminent physicists” as fatal to my conclusions,
he thereupon expresses dissent from the premises of that argument;
and the reasons he gives for dissenting are like those given by me
before he was out of his teens!</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>It is not always easy to disentangle misrepresentations; especially
when they are woven into a fabric. For elucidation of this
matter there needs another section. It may fitly begin with an
analogy. An astronomer who “saw reason to think” that the
swarm of November meteors this year would be greater than usual,
would be surprised if the occurrence of a smaller number were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
cited in disproof of his astronomical beliefs at large. It would be
held that so undecided a phrase as “saw reason to think,” not implying
a definite deduction, did not implicate his general conceptions
nor appreciably discredit them. Professor Ward, however,
thinks a tentative opinion is equivalent to a positive assertion. In
the course of the foregoing argument (p. 191) he represents me
as saying that “there is an alternation of evolution and dissolution
in the totality of things.” He does not quote the whole clause,
which runs thus:&mdash;“For <i>if</i>, as we saw <i>reason to think</i>, there is an
alternation of evolution and dissolution in the totality of things, &amp;c.”
Here, then, are two qualifying expressions which he suppresses; and
not only does he here suppress them, but elsewhere he refers to this
passage as not speculative, but quite positive. On p. 197 he <span class="locked">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“But of a single supreme evolution embracing them all we have no
title to speak: not even to assume that it is, much less to say what it is;
least of all to <i>affirm confidently</i> that it can be embraced in such a meaningless
formula as the integration of matter and the dissipation of
motion.” [The italics are mine.]</p></blockquote>

<p>So that a hypothetical inference (implied by “if”), drawn from
avowedly uncertain data (implied by “reason to think”), he transforms
into an unhesitating assertion. He does this in presence of
my statement that respecting transformations of the Universe as a
whole, no “legitimate conclusions” can be drawn, and that we
must be forever “without answer to this transcendent question.”
Nay, he does it in presence of a still more specific repudiation of
certainty. Section 182 <span class="locked">begins:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Here we come to the question raised at the close of the last chapter&mdash;does
Evolution as a whole, like Evolution in detail, advance toward
complete quiescence? Is that motionless state called death, which ends
Evolution in organic bodies, typical of the universal death in which
Evolution at large must end?...</p>

<p>“To so speculative an inquiry, none but a speculative answer is to be
expected. Such answer as may be ventured, must be taken less as a
positive answer than as a demurrer to the conclusion that the proximate
result must be the ultimate result” (p. 529). Instead of being a positive
answer, it is intended to <i>exclude</i> a positive answer.</p></blockquote>

<p>One more instance may be given to illustrate Professor Ward’s
mode of discrediting views which he dislikes. On p. 198 of his first
volume occurs the <span class="locked">sentence&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“At any rate such a conception is less conjectural and more adequate
than Mr. Spencer’s ridiculous comparison of the universe to a spinning
top that begins by ‘wabbling,’ passes into a state of steady motion or
<i>equilibrium mobile</i>, and finally comes to rest.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">The reader who seeks a warrant for this representation will seek in
vain. If, in the chapter of <i>First Principles</i> on “Equilibration,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
turns to section 171, where the celestial applications of the general
law are considered, he will find the Solar System alone instanced as
having progressed toward a moving equilibrium; and the moving
equilibrium even of this not compared as alleged. Neither in that
section nor in any subsequent section of the chapter, is any larger
celestial aggregate mentioned as progressing toward a moving equilibrium.
Contrariwise, in the succeeding chapter on “Dissolution,”
it is said that “the irregular distribution of our Sidereal
System” is “such as to render even a temporary moving equilibrium
impossible” (p. 531). On pp. 533&ndash;4 it is contended that
even local aggregations of stars, still more the whole Sidereal System,
must eventually reach a diffused state without passing through
any such stage. And had not conclusions respecting the changes
of the Universe been excluded as exceeding the bounds even of
speculation (p. 536), it is clear that still more of the Universe would
no moving equilibrium have been alleged; but, had anything been
alleged, it would have been the reverse. How, then, has it been
possible, the reader will ask, for Professor Ward to write the sentence
above quoted? If instead of vainly seeking through the sections
devoted to “Equilibration” and “Dissolution” in relation to
celestial phenomena, he turns back to some introductory pages he
will find a clew. I have pointed out that in an aggregate having
compounded motions, one of the constituent motions may be dissipated
while the rest continue; and that in some such cases there
is established a moving equilibrium. In illustration I have taken
“the most familiar example”&mdash;“that of the spinning top”; and
to remind the reader of one of the movements thus dissipated while
the rest continue, I have used the word “wabbling”; there being
no other descriptive word. What then has Professor Ward done?
That mode of establishing an equilibrium which the spinning top exemplifies,
he represents as extended by me to celestial phenomena,
though no such comparison is made nor any such word used. Nay,
he has done so notwithstanding my assertion that a moving equilibrium
of our sidereal system is negatived, and regardless of the
implied assertion that still more would be negatived a moving equilibrium
of the Universe, could we with any rationality speculate
about it. Actually in defiance of all this, he says I compare the
motion of the Universe to that of a “wabbling” top. Having constructed
a grotesque fancy, he labels it “ridiculous” and then debits
me with it.</p>

<p>I can not pursue further this examination of Professor Ward’s
criticisms: other things have to be done. Whether what has been
said will lead readers to discount the laudatory expressions I quoted
at the outset, it is not for me to say. But I think I have said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
enough to warn them that before accepting Professor Ward’s versions
of my views, it will be prudent to verify them.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Postscript.</span>&mdash;I said that I did not propose to discuss Professor
Ward’s own philosophy, and I contented myself with quoting his
summary of it&mdash;“Nature is Spirit.” It occurs to me, however,
that as showing the point of view from which his criticisms are
made, it may not be amiss to give readers a rather more specific
conception of his philosophy, by reproducing a laudatory quotation
he makes. Here it <span class="locked">is:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“If ‘rational synthesis’ of things is what we seek, it is surely more
reasonable to say with Lotze: ‘What lies beneath all is not a quantity
which is bound eternally to the same limits and compelled through many
diverse arrangements, continuously varied, to manifest always the very
same total. On the contrary, should <i>the self-realization of the Idea</i> [!]
require it, there is nothing to hinder the working elements of the world
being at one period more numerous and yet more intense; at another
period less intense as well as fewer’” (i., 218). [The italics are mine.]</p></blockquote>

<p>It is worth remarking that on the opposite page some of my
views are characterized as “astounding feats of philosophical jugglery”!</p>

<h2 id="destructive">DESTRUCTIVE EFFECTS OF VAGRANT ELECTRICITY.<br />

<span class="subhead small notbold"><span class="smcap">By</span> HUBERT S. WYNKOOP, M. E.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">Reverting</span> to the dictionary for a definition, electrolysis is
“the process of decomposing a chemical compound by the passage
of an electric current through it.” Electroplating is a popular
illustration of this definition, having been numbered among the
industrial arts for nearly a century.</p>

<p>If in a bath of sulphate-of-copper solution are placed a copper
plate and a plumbago-covered wax mold, the passage of an electric
current through the solution, <i>from</i> the plate <i>to</i> the mold, will result
in the deposition of copper upon the mold, or negative electrode,
and the wasting away of the plate of copper, or positive
electrode. Generalizing from this and other experiments, it may
be broadly stated that the passage of an electric current through a
solution of electrolyzable metallic salt, <i>from</i> an oxidizable metal
<i>to</i> some other conductor, will be attended by the separation of the
salt into two parts: first, the metal, appearing at the negative electrode;
and, second, an unstable compound of the remaining elements.
This unstable compound is supposed to unite with the
hydrogen of the water, liberating oxygen, and forming an acid.
Both oxygen and acid appear only at the positive electrode, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
is thus made subject to a double decay&mdash;a corrosion by oxygen and
a solution by acid.</p>

<p>There is nothing new about this. It is not even a novel statement
of a fundamental electro-chemical truth. In times past, however,
we were wont to consider this matter as pertaining solely to
the laboratory or to the electroplating industry; now we are forced
to see that the reproduction of this experiment on a grand scale is
attended with results as disagreeable as they are widespread.</p>

<p>Hidden beneath our highways lie gas pipes, water pipes, railway
tracks, Edison tubes, cement-lined iron subway ducts, and lead-covered
cables. These are the electrodes. In contact with these
conductors is the soil, containing an electrolyzable salt&mdash;chloride,
nitrate or sulphate of ammonia, potash, soda, or magnesia, generally.
In the presence of moisture this soil becomes an electrolyte, or
salt solution. In the absence of electricity no appreciable damage
occurs; but the passage of an electric current, no matter how small,
from one pipe to another is sure, sooner or later, to leave its traces
upon the positive conductor in the form of a decay other than
mere oxidation. It is to this decay that has been given the name
of <i>electrolysis</i>; so that when this heading appears in the daily press
or in technical journals one may interpret the term popularly as
“the electrolytic corrosion of metals buried in the soil.”</p>

<p>To produce electrolytic disintegration of pipes, etc., on a scale
grand enough to cause apprehension, a bountiful source of electricity
is essential. Unfortunately, this condition is not lacking
to-day in any town in which the usual overhead trolley electric
railway is in operation. This system of electric propulsion is
based upon the use of a “ground return”&mdash;that is to say, the electricity
passes out from the power house to the bare trolley wire,
thence to the pole on the roof of the car, thence through the motors
to the wheels, whence it is expected to return to the power house,
<i>via</i> the rails.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, however, the released electricity by no
means confines itself to the rails and the copper return feeders&mdash;legitimate
paths provided for it. It avails itself, on the other
hand, of what may be termed, for brevity’s sake, the illegitimate
return&mdash;comprising all underground electrical conductors except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
the rails and return feeders, and including subterranean water-courses,
sewers, and metallic earth veins.</p>

<p class="notbold">The fibrous appearance of the surface is characteristic of wrought iron and steel.</p></div></div>

<p>In the light of our
experience of the last
eight years, it is easy
to identify as electrolysis
the effects shown in
the accompanying cuts
of buried metals that
have been actually subjected
to a flow of electricity.
It is not to be
inferred that the destructive
action here
depicted is universal
throughout our towns,
but, rather, that the
damage occurs in spots,
its rate of progress being
dependent upon the
amount of current and
the duration of the
flow. Dry, sandy soils
tend to keep down the
flow of current by interposing
a high resistance,
so that in such
localities electrolytic effects
are not as pronounced
as in wet,
loamy soils. In the
same way, the character
of the pipe surface&mdash;or
coating, if there be
any&mdash;acts as a partial
barrier to check the passage
of electricity.</p>

<p>Until recently it
was generally supposed
that cast iron was not
attacked&mdash;at least not
rapidly enough to cause
alarm. In Brooklyn the
water mains, of very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
hard, dense, even-grained cast iron, containing alloyed rather than
combined carbon, have not been appreciably corroded. At Dayton,
Ohio, on the other hand, seventy-seven thousand dollars’ worth
of damage has already resulted. One peculiarity of electrolyzed
cast iron is that the original shape is usually retained, the iron
being eaten away and leaving a punky formation of pure or nearly
pure graphite. In such a case a superficial examination detects
nothing wrong, and it requires a mechanical scraping to show that
the strength is not there. For this reason good photographs of
cast-iron electrolysis are somewhat hard to obtain.</p>

    <div class="captionh notbold">The collapsed appearance
of the pipe is due entirely to the removal of the lead by electrolysis, the bore
retaining its original shape. The dark spot on the upper surface of the pipe is the point
of rupture. One third size.</div></div>

<p>The reason for the comparative immunity of cast iron is not
as yet definitely understood. It certainly does not lie particularly
in the asphaltic varnish usually applied, for this varnish affords
little or no protection when used upon wrought iron or other metals.
Nor can it be accounted for by the composition of cast iron itself,
inasmuch as a fractured or brightly scraped surface of cast iron
shows approximately the same symptoms as other metals when
acted upon by a given current for a given time. Whether the iron
oxide is the saving feature, or whether the “skin” due to the
process of casting acts as an insulator, is not yet settled.</p>

<p>When the trouble first appeared in Boston, in 1891, its cause
was promptly identified. The electric-railway construction of those
days was so crude, however, that many well-informed electricians
fell into the error of assuming that heavier rails, more and larger
return feeders, and better bonding (i. e., wire connections from rail
to rail, around the joints, designed to decrease the resistance) would
prove a panacea for all electrolytic ills. Indeed, this view is still
held by a surprisingly large number of men versed in matters
electrical.</p>

<p>I am of the opinion that it is impossible, from a financial standpoint,
to provide so satisfactory a legitimate return that considerable
electricity will not seek a path through pipes, cable covers,
etc.; for, in order to confine the electric current to the rails, the
resistance of the earth and its contained pipes would have to be
infinitely great, and this condition can be realized only by making
the resistance of the rail infinitely small as compared with that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
the earth. The cost of arriving at this condition is prohibitive,
and the improved track return is, and always must be, a palliative
merely, not a cure.</p>

<p>Assuming, then, that under the most favorable character of electric-railway
construction some of the current may be expected to
stray from the straight and narrow path, it behooves us to consider
how it may best be cared for in order that it may not cause electrolysis.
Since corrosion of this nature occurs only at those points where
electricity <i>leaves</i> the metal, one might suppose that the attachment
of a conducting wire to the affected part would result in the harmless
carrying away of the current. In isolated cases, in small towns,
such a plan might accomplish the desired result. It is open to the
objection, however, that it in a measure legalizes the conveyance
of electricity on conductors other than those designed for the purpose.
In larger towns, with more than one power house and with
car lines radiating from and circumscribing the business center,
the attachment of conducting wires entails a ceaseless disturbance
of the electrical equilibrium, curing the evil in spots and developing
new danger points. Furthermore, these connections tend to
decrease the resistance of the total illegitimate return, thereby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
tempting a greater flow of electricity along other paths than the
rails and track feeders. It has been generally believed that this
increased current would develop electrolysis at the ends of the pipes,
due to the jumping of the electricity around the presumably high
resistance of the joints; and, indeed, many samples of such corrosion
are in existence. I have found, however, that it is possible
to calk a bell-and-spigot joint in cast-iron pipe in such a manner
that the resistance is practically <i>nil</i>; and as for wrought iron or
steel, the joint resistance may be made as low as we please by
fitting the surfaces so carefully that white-leading is unnecessary.</p>

<p>Arguing from the fact that the negative electrode is not attacked,
it has been suggested to employ an auxiliary dynamo and
a special system of wiring, in order to maintain the pipes, etc., at
all times and at all points, negative to the rails. Could this ideal
condition be realized, the rails alone would suffer. We can not
hope, however, to thus easily solve the problem in towns where the
distribution of buried conductors is at all complex.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Lead Service Pipe showing the Irregularity of Electrolytic Action, or what is
technically known as “Pitting.”</span></div></div>

<p>It has been suggested, also, to discourage the flow of electricity
along pipes and cable covers by inserting insulating sections of
wood or terra cotta. This plan has never been tried on a scale
large enough to afford a suitable demonstration of its utility.
While it might reasonably be tried on new construction, its application<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
to old work is almost prohibited by the attendant
expense.</p>

<div id="ip_363" class="figcenter" style="width: 581px;">

    <span class="notbold">The other side of this pipe is smooth and clean.</span></p></div></div>

<p>Attacking the problem from a directly opposite standpoint,
there seems to be a chance of successfully invoking the aid of some
purely chemical method of rendering lead and iron innocuous, electrolytically
speaking. If we can obtain an insulating oxide, lacquer,
or varnish that will retain its high-resistance properties during
the ordinary lifetime of the buried metal, it will be possible to
effectually protect pipes and cable coverings by coating them prior
to burial. Or, if we can stumble upon an electrolysis-proof alloy,
formed by the addition of a few per cent of some foreign metal to
the pipe material during manufacture, the buried conductor will
need no protection whatever.</p>

<p>But, supposing that we discover this lacquer or this alloy and
by such means guard against damage to all new construction, how
are we to care for the metals already buried? We can not dig
them all up and paint them, neither can we attempt to replace
them by the new alloy. I do not see that the state of the art
to-day presents any solution of the difficulty, other than the banishment
of the single trolley system. None of the electrical remedies
(so called) offers more than partial and temporary relief, and
the chemical field is just beginning to be explored.</p>

<p>Permit me to state most emphatically that this is not intended
as an argument in favor of the abolishment of single trolley systems.
Our civilization owes more to them than could be rehearsed
in catalogue form within the limits of one issue of this magazine.
We have nothing at present that can be employed as a satisfactory
substitute for the ordinary electric railway. The underground
trolley is a safe substitute, but the great expense of installation
renders it available for very few localities. The overhead trolley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
with two wires and no ground return, is cumbersome, vexatious,
and unsightly. The storage battery is more or less experimental
in its nature.
The electro-magnetic
contact systems,
with plates set
in the pavement
at stated intervals,
make no pretense
of avoiding electrolytic
troubles. The
compressed-air motor
has yet to receive
popular approval.</p>

    <span class="notbold">In this instance the outer covering consists of a salt of lead, having no strength whatever.</span></p></div></div>

<p>There seems to
be a mistaken impression
abroad that
the railway companies
are indifferent
to this subject. So
far as my experience
and information
go, this is not
the case. They are
only too anxious to
find a remedy&mdash;not,
as some electricians
have stated, to save
their coal-pile, for
energy is wasted in
forcing the electricity
back to the
power house, no
matter what the
path, but because
they fear that at
some future date
the taxpayer, the
corporation, and the
municipality will
band together, present
overwhelming
bills for damages,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
and sweep the trolleys off the face of the earth. The instinct of
self-preservation, if nothing else, demands that the electric-railway
companies should put forth every endeavor to solve the electrolysis
problem.</p>

<p>And yet, conservative judgment requires that the railway companies
should not take the initiative. It is one of boyhood’s maxims
not to shoot arrows at a hornet’s nest unless one has mud
handy to apply to the subsequently afflicted part. Thus it happens
that the railway company remains apparently inactive, bearing
the burden of public condemnation, while we, whose lethargy
is responsible for failing pipes, read electrolysis articles in the daily
press and wonder how soon the impending catastrophe is likely to
occur.</p>

<p>This condition of affairs is deplorable; for, while we may not
care how extensively or how frequently the city authorities or the
private corporations are obliged to renew their underground metals,
we are at least vitally concerned as to whether the stray electricity
is endangering our steel office buildings, our bridges, our water
supply, our immunity from conflagrations, and the safety of the
hundred and one appliances that go to make up our modern civilization.</p>

<p>Are the Brooklyn Bridge anchor plates going to pieces, or are
they not? Are the elevated railroad structures about to fall apart,
or are they not? The consulting electrical engineer says “Yes,”
the railway man says “No.” The municipal authorities say nothing.
“When doctors disagree&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>I deem it doubly unfortunate that so much valuable brain
energy has been inefficiently expended in the discussion of electrolysis.
Each writer has viewed it from his own standpoint.
Electrical literature has acquired in this way a series of views, interesting
and instructive, but also bewildering. There is no composite
view, such as might be obtained from the report of a commission
composed of a technical representative of each of the interests
affected. So far as I am able to learn, such a commission
has never existed.</p>

<hr class="note" />

<p>A curious coincidence of superstitions, illustrating anew how all men
are kin, is exemplified in the native belief, mentioned in Mrs. R. Langloh
Perkins’s book of More Australian Legendary Tales, that any child who
touches one of the brilliant fungi growing on dead trees&mdash;which are called
“devil’s bread”&mdash;will be spirited away by ghosts. An English reviewer
of the book remembers having been dragged away from a fungus of this
kind for the same reason. In the north of England children used to be
told that, if they touched the dangerous growths, a fungus of the same
kind would grow from the tip of every finger.</p>

<h2 title="WINTER BIRDS IN A CITY PARK" id="winter">WINTER BIRDS IN A CITY PARK.<br />

<span class="subhead small notbold"><span class="smcap">By JAMES B. CARRINGTON.</span></span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Most</span> of us are so used to thinking of birds, if we notice them
at all, as belonging to spring and summer that we easily fail
to see or hear the comparatively few feathered winter visitors.
Among these, however, are some of the most attractive and amusing
of birds, and to hear their cheery notes and to watch their busy
hunt for food on a cold winter day adds a very considerable pleasure
to a walk in a city park or the near-by woods. In New York
city bird lovers have learned that Central Park is one of the very
best places in which to watch birds both summer and winter. There
is room enough there and the conditions are varied enough to
offer congenial dwelling places for nearly all of the better-known
birds. In the spring and fall the beautiful and tiny migrating
wood warblers find
the park a good feeding
ground, and a safe
place wherein to linger
for a brief time on
their journeys north and
south.</p>

<p>With the approach
of winter the innumerable
fat and saucy robins
that have hunted angleworms
and strutted
about the lawns of the
park since early spring
disappear, except for an
occasional hardy fellow
who perhaps prefers the
dangers of a northern
winter to those of the
long journey southward.
The wood- and the hermit-thrush;
the veery, or
Wilson’s thrush; the yellow
warbler, so abundant and so musical; the perky little redstart,
whose song of “Sweet, sweet, sweeter” closely resembles
the yellow warbler’s; the somber-colored blackbirds; the Baltimore
and the orchard oriole; the scarlet tanager; the catbird;
Phœbe; Jenny Wren; the tiny chipping sparrow; the vireos; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
many other familiar warm-weather friends have also journeyed
southward.</p>

<p>The bare trees and the ground brown with fallen leaves have to
some a bleak and dreary look, but this is because a wrong impression
has gone abroad
concerning them.
Nature in winter is
not dead, not even
sleeping; she is all
the time storing up
energy to enable
her to greet the returning
sun in her
very best dress. If
you will look carefully
at the bare
limbs and branches
of the trees and
bushes, you will see
the little buds that
are slowly but surely
swelling up with
the pride of young,
active, vigorous life,
only waiting, with
the great patience
of Nature, for the
proper and suitable
time to break away from their winter retirement and take up
their part in the new year.</p>

<p>Some of the pleasantest days I have ever known in the open
have been spent in the winter woods, when the snow was on the
ground and everything <i>seemed</i> still and unfamiliar. Every little
sound is accented on a cold day, and the creaking of a swaying
limb or the note of a bird comes to you with almost startling distinctness.
Somehow you feel on such days that you are more a
part of the things about you than in the full flush of summer. It
is like meeting people stripped of all the artificial distinctions of
clothes and position.</p>

<p>There is something fine in the way the trees stand up in winter;
no one can fail to understand what is meant by the “sturdy
oak.” They seem to feel pretty much as you do, and show a
spirit of vigorous resistance and power to enjoy and cope with the
worst that Jack Frost can bring, and the bright sun sends the sap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
tingling through their limbs just as it does the blood through yours.
One day especially that I remember in Central Park brought me
a somewhat novel experience, and gave me the privilege of transferring
some old bird acquaintance to the list of my bird friends.
It was after a fall of snow, and the air was crisp and sharp, indeed
it was nipping, and standing still was a chilly occupation. From long
familiarity I knew just about where to go to find certain birds, and I
was not disappointed in my hunt. My overcoat pocket, it is needless
to say, was fully stocked with peanuts and a box of bird seed,
and demands were very soon made upon the peanut supply by the
fat and friendly gray squirrels that come bravely up to your hand
to be fed. They have a most attractive and appealing way of approaching
you. The more timid ones stop often to sit up inquiringly,
and put one hand on their heart, as if to stop its excited beating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
The first birds I saw were the rugged and noisy English sparrows,
written down in most bird books as “pests,” but I confess I
could not resist giving them a crumb or two, for they appeal to
my sympathies much as the plucky little <i>gamin</i> newsboys of the
streets do, and then, too, I have learned that their loud chatter and
rush for food attract more desirable acquaintances. I soon heard
the sharp, shrill peep of the white-throated sparrows, and listened
to their scratching “with both feet” under the bushes. Now and
then one would try his throat with his full song, two sweet whistles
followed by very plain calls for “Peabody, peabody, peabody.”
They are called the peabody bird by many. There is no mistaking
this beautiful sparrow. Among a bunch of his noisy English neighbors
the rich brown of his feathers is easily seen, and the three white
stripes on his head and the white patch on the throat attract your
eye at once. In a group of thirty or forty whitethroats that were
feeding on my bird seed I noticed also two plump song sparrows.
They are brown, too, but smaller than the whitethroats, and their
breasts are streaked with dark-brown stripes, with a spot right in
the center. This is the sparrow that makes music for us from very
early spring until late in the autumn. I have heard them in February,
with the snow yet on the ground, perched on the tip of some
bush and singing away with a joyfulness that made everything take
on a more cheerful look. While I was watching the whitethroats
I heard the jolly little song that I especially hoped for, and very
soon had a near view of wee Mr. Chickadee himself, with his jet-black
head, throat, and chin, and gray cheeks. He, in company
with several of his friends, came down to feed at once, and hopped
about my feet and a near-by bench to pick up the bits of peanut
I had dropped for his benefit. The chickadees are always
“chummy” little birds, and seem to have found their human acquaintances
in general pretty good sort of people. After a time
I put some peanut crumbs in my hand and held it out invitingly.
The chickadees would alight on the tree over my head, sing their
song, look down inquiringly, and then fly off, apparently interested
in searching for some important business they had overlooked
on the bark of another tree. Gradually, however, one became
more familiar and finally lighted on my hand with entire confidence,
selected the largest piece of peanut to be had, and flew away
to eat it. He held the bit between both feet on a bench, and leaned
forward and pecked away until it disappeared. Occasionally he
would hold a small piece in one foot only. One little fellow stopped
to sing me his Chick-a-dee-dee-dee, as he perched on my little finger,
before selecting his morsel. They followed me about the
paths, and wherever I stopped there were sure to be several chickadees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
peeping about the tree trunks asking me to please give
them more peanuts. While this was going on I heard a hoarse
“Quank, quank, quank!” that sounded very near, and on looking
up saw a white-breasted nuthatch, a blue-gray bird with a
very distinct black band on the top of his head that extends back
across his shoulders. His short tail and legs make him look very
funny when on the ground. On a tree, however, he is a regular
circus, walking head up or head down on the limbs and trunk,
and now and then doing the giant swing, completely circling
some twig, just to show what he can do when he tries. He
was attracted by the noise and conduct of the chickadees, his
winter companions, and was calling for something for himself.
His long, slim bill is not made for cracking things as the sparrows
can with their short, strong bills, but he punches holes in
them very much as the woodpeckers do. When he came down
to the path and picked up a peanut he flew off to a near-by tree
and hunted up and down until he found a place in the bark where
he could wedge the nut in and then proceeded to hatch or crack it
into bits to suit his taste. A brown creeper was walking up his
tree a short distance away very much as the nuthatch does, poking
his long, curved bill into the bark, though I did not see him for
some time, as his brown and gray feathers were so like the color
of the tree on which he walked. He circles round the trunk or
limb, and you have to keep a sharp lookout to get more than an
occasional rapid glance at him. A loud rapping and a noise that
sounded a good deal like a giggle attracted my attention to a downy
black-and-white woodpecker, with a bright-red spot on the back of
his head. He was hammering away with all his might, and the
limb on which he hung, back down, fairly rattled as he drove his
chisel-like bill into the wood. Another woodpecker, the big and
beautifully marked flicker, with his brown back barred with black,
his spotted breast with its big black crescent and the red band on
the back of his head, stopped for a minute or two on a tree a
hundred feet away. His cry of alarm rang out shrilly as he flew
away. All of these birds are handsomely marked, though none
of them compare, in the mere matter of color, with some of the
many beautiful summer species. There was one bird there that
day, though, whose brilliant plumage and altogether tropical aspect
comes as a great surprise to the unaccustomed visitor to the park
in winter. As he lighted on the snow-covered ground among a
group of feeding whitethroats the cardinal, with his splendid crest,
stood out like a jet of flame, and the black spot at the base of his
bill only made the rest of him seem the brighter. Mr. and Mrs.
Cardinal spend their winters regularly in Central Park, and I hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
or see them every time I go there. His only note now is a sharp
squeak of alarm, but a little later he will perch high up in some
tree near the lake and awake the echoes with his loud whistling.
High over my head, mere specks of shining white against the blue-gray
of the sky, I could see several gulls floating along on their
way to the reservoir, where hundreds of them often gather in the
open water that is usually found in the center. As I walked toward
the entrance of the park, on my way to the car, I heard, on some
cedars near the border of the lake, the gurgling music of a party
of goldfinches. They had on their winter coats of yellowish brown,
but their song and dipping flight made them easily recognizable.</p>

<p>Once you become acquainted with a few birds, every flutter
of a wing or cheep or peep becomes an object of interest and a
motive for many days in the open. It is very easy also to sentimentalize
about Nature and to assume a patronizing air toward her,
but the more you know of her and her ways the sooner you get
over this. You can not help being impressed with the fact that
the life and ways of the animals and birds are, after all, in many
ways very like your own. Birds, you will find, are very human
indeed, and show a wide diversity in disposition and habit. There
is one thing sure to follow an interest of this kind, and that is a
greater respect and care for wild life. The cruelty of egg-collecting
and the wanton destruction of birds for millinery purposes are
becoming less tolerable every year in civilized communities.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Old</span> Rattler was a snake, of course, and he lived in the
King’s River Cañon, high up and down deep in the mountains
of California.</p>

<p>He had a hole behind and below a large, flat granite rock, not
far from the river, and he called it his home; for in it he slept
all night and all winter, but when the sun came back in the spring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
and took the frost out of the air and the rocks, then he crawled
out to lie until he got warm. The stream was clear and swift in
the cañon, the waterfalls sang in the side gulch of Roaring River,
the wind rustled in the long needles of the yellow pines, and the
birds called to their mates in the branches. But Old Rattler did
not care for such things. He was just a snake, you know, and his
neighbors did not think him a good snake at that, for he was surly
and silent, and his big, three-cornered, “coffin-shaped” head, set
on a slim, flat neck, was very ugly to see. But when he opened
his mouth he was uglier still, for in his upper jaw he had two long
fangs, and each one was filled with deadly poison. His vicious
old head was covered with gray and wrinkled scales, and his black,
beadlike eyes snapped when he opened his mouth to find out
whether his fangs were both in working order.</p>

<p>Old Rattler was pretty stiff when he first came from his hole
on the morning of this story. He had lain all night coiled up like
a rope among the rocks, and his tail felt very cold. But the glad
sun warmed the cockles of his heart, and in an hour or two he became
limber, and this made him happy in his snaky fashion. But,
being warm, he began to be hungry, for it had been a whole month
since he had eaten anything. When the first new moon of August
came, his skin loosened everywhere and slipped down over his
eyes like a veil, so that he could see nothing about him, and could
not hunt for frogs by the river nor for chipmunks among the trees.
But with the new moon of September all this was over. The
rusty brown old coat was changed for a new suit of gray and black,
and the diamond-shaped checkers all over it were clean and shiny
as a set of new clothes ought to be.</p>

<p>There was a little striped chipmunk running up and down the
sugar-pine tree over his head, pursing his little mouth and throwing
himself into pretty attitudes, as though he were the center of
an admiring audience, and Old Rattler kept a steady eye on him.
But he was in no hurry about it all. He must first get the kinks
out of his neck, and the cold cramps from his tail. There was
an old curse on his family, so the other beasts had heard, that
kept him always cold, and his tail was the coldest part of all. So
he shook it a little, just to show that it was growing limber, and
the bone clappers on the end rustled with a sharp, angry noise.
Fifteen rattles he had in all&mdash;fifteen and a button&mdash;and to have
so many showed that he was no common member of his hated
family. Then he shook his tail again, and more sharply. This
was to show all the world that he, Old Rattler, was wide awake,
and whoever stepped on him would better look out. Then all the
big beasts and little beasts who heard the noise fled away just as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
fast as ever they could; and to run away was the best thing they
could do, for when Old Rattler struck one of them with his fangs
all was over with him. So there were many in the cañon, beasts
and birds and snakes too, who hated Old Rattler, but only a few
dared face him. And one of these was <span class="locked">Glittershield,<a name="FNanchor_B" id="FNanchor_B" href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">B</a></span> whom men
call the King of Snakes, and in a minute I shall tell you why.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_B" id="Footnote_B" href="#FNanchor_B" class="fnanchor">B</a> <i>Lampropeltis zonatus.</i></p></div>

<p>And when Old Rattler was doing all that I have said, the King
Snake lay low on a bed of pine needles, behind a bunch of fern,
and watched with keen, sharp eye. The angry buzz of Rattler’s
tail, which scared the chipmunks and the bullfrogs and all the
rest of the beast folk, was music for Glittershield. He was a
snake too, and snakes understand some things better than any of
the rest of us.</p>

<p>Glittershield was slim and wiry in his body, as long as Old
Rattler himself, but not so large around. His coat was smooth
and glossy, not rough and wrinkly like Old Rattler’s, and his upraised
head was small and pretty&mdash;for a snake. He was the best
dressed of all his kind, and he looked his finest as he faced Old
Rattler. His head was shiny black, his throat and neck as white
as milk, while all down his body to the end of his tail he was
painted with rings, first white, then black, then crimson, and every
ring was bright as if it had just been freshly polished that very day.</p>

<p>So the King Snake passed the sheltering fern and came right
up to Old Rattler. Rattler opened his sleepy eyes, threw himself
on guard with a snap and a buzz, and shook his bony clappers
savagely. But the King of Snakes was not afraid. Every snake
has a weak spot somewhere, and that is the place to strike him.
If he hadn’t a weak spot no one else could live about him, and
then perhaps he would starve to death at last. If he had not some
strong points, where no one could harm him, he couldn’t live
himself.</p>

<p>As the black crest rose, Old Rattler’s tail grew cold, his head
dropped, his mouth closed, he straightened out his coil, and staggered
helplessly toward his hole.</p>

<p>This was the chance for Glittershield. With a dash so swift
that all the rings on his body&mdash;red, white, and black&mdash;melted into
one purple flash, he seized Old Rattler by his throat. He carried
no weapons, to be sure. He had neither fangs nor venom.
He won his victories by force and dash, not by mean advantage.
He was quick and strong, and his little hooked teeth held like the
claws of a hawk. Old Rattler closed his mouth because he couldn’t
help it, and the fangs he could not use were folded back against
the roof of his jaw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
The King Snake leaped forward, wound his body in a “love-knot”
around Old Rattler’s neck, took a “half-hitch” with his
tail about the stomach, while the rest of his body lay in a curve
like the letter S between the two knots. Then all he had to do
was to stiffen up his muscles, and Old Rattler’s backbone was
snapped off at the neck.</p>

<p>All that remained to Glittershield was to swallow his enemy.
First he rubbed his lips all over the body, from the head to the
tail, till it was slippery with slime. Then he opened his mouth
very wide, with a huge snaky yawn, and face to face he began
on Old Rattler. The ugly head was hard to manage, but, after
much straining, he clasped his jaws around it, and the venom
trickled down his throat like some fiery sauce. Slowly head and
neck and body disappeared, and the tail wriggled despairingly,
for the tail of the snake folk can not die till sundown, and when
it went at last the fifteen rattles and the button were keeping up
an angry buzz. And all night long the King of Snakes, twice as
big as he ought to be, lay gorged and motionless upon Old Rattler’s
rock.</p>

<p>And in the morning the little chipmunk ran out on a limb above
him, pursed up his lips, and made all kinds of faces, as much as
to say, “I did all this, and the whole world was watching while
I did it.”</p>

<h2 title="REMARKABLE VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS IN THE PHILIPPINES" id="remarkable">REMARKABLE VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS IN THE PHILIPPINES.<br />

<span class="subhead small notbold"><span class="smcap">By R. L. PACKARD.</span></span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Every</span> one knows that the Philippine archipelago, like other
regions in its neighborhood, abounds in volcanoes, some of
which are still active, while the majority are extinct. Some geologists
have tried to distribute the Philippine volcanoes into two
parallel belts or lines running in a general northwest and southeast
direction, following the trend of the island group, and extending
from the southern end of Mindanao to the northern part of
Luzon&mdash;some sixteen degrees of latitude. Early, possibly prehistoric,
volcanic activity in the group has left its imprint upon
the native mythology, as was the case in the Mediterranean, and
an explanation of some of the mythical stories is to be found in
earth movements. The Spaniards have given accounts of many
eruptions in the last three hundred years, which were remarkable
either from the destruction they caused or the terror they inspired.
Some of these accounts were written by the terrified eyewitnesses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
themselves, such as the monks in charge of parishes where the greatest
damage was done, and are sufficiently vivid, however much
they may lack of what would now be called “scientific” accuracy.</p>

<p>Probably the most remarkable volcanic outburst in historical
times, on account of the distance apart of the simultaneous eruptions,
although its intensity might not be regarded as great when
compared with that of Krakatoa, was that of January 4, 1641,
when a volcano on the southeastern extremity of Mindanao, another
on the northern coast of the island of Sulu to the west, and
a third in Luzon far to the north, became active at the same time.
A translation of the original Spanish report of this extraordinary
phenomenon, which is extremely rare and practically inaccessible
to students, is given in Jagor’s <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Reisen in den Philippinen</i>. From
this it appears that upon two occasions, toward the end of December,
1640, volcanic ashes fell at Zamboanga (on the southwest
coast of Mindanao) and covered the fields like a light frost. On
January 1, 1641, the auxiliary fleet carrying troops from Manila
to the island of Ternate was off Zamboanga, and on the 3d, at
about 7 <span class="smcap smaller">P. M.</span>, people in the latter place heard what they supposed
was artillery and musketry firing at some miles’ distance.
Believing that an enemy was attacking the coast, preparations
were made to meet him, and the commander of the galleys sent
a boat out to see if any of the vessels of the fleet needed assistance,
but the boat returned without finding the fleet.</p>

<p>On the next day, January 4, 1641, at about 9 <span class="smcap smaller">A. M.</span>, the noise
of the supposed cannonading increased to such an extent that
it was feared in Zamboanga that the Spanish fleet had been attacked
by the Dutch, with whom the Spaniards were then at war.
This noise lasted about half an hour, when it became evident that
it was not caused by artillery, but proceeded from the outbreak
of a volcano, for, toward noon, thick darkness began to spread
over the sky to the south, which soon covered that part of the
heavens and gradually spread over the whole sky, so that by 1
<span class="smcap smaller">P. M.</span> it was as dark as night, and by 2 <span class="smcap smaller">P. M.</span> the darkness had so
increased that one could not distinguish objects a short distance
off. Candles were lighted, and a great fear fell upon the people,
who fled to the churches to pray and confess. This darkness, during
which no light was visible in the whole horizon, lasted until
2 <span class="smcap smaller">A. M.</span>, when the moon became visible, to the great joy of both
Spaniards and Indians, who were afraid of being buried beneath
the ashes which had been falling since 2 <span class="smcap smaller">P. M.</span> The fleet, which
was then passing the southern end of Mindanao, was thrown into
confusion by the tumult of the elements, and was in darkness
earlier than Zamboanga&mdash;viz., at 10 <span class="smcap smaller">A. M.</span>&mdash;because it was nearer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
the volcano. The darkness was so intense that the crews believed
the last day had come, and the vessels were endangered by the
heavy shower of stones, ashes, and earth which fell upon them
and which the men hastened to throw overboard. The ships’ lanterns
were lighted as at night. The volcano could be seen, at a
considerable distance, throwing up columns of flame which, on
descending, set the neighboring woods on fire. The darkness covered
the greater part of Mindanao, which is a very large island,
and the ashes were carried to Cebu, Panay, and other islands, and
there was an especially heavy fall on the island of Jolo (Sulu),
which is more than forty leagues west by south from the southeast
point of Mindanao, where the volcano burst out. On this
island, on account of the darkness and the general uproar, the
source of the ashes which fell there was not known at the time,
but when it became light enough to see it was found that at the
same time with the eruption on Mindanao a second volcano had
burst out upon a small island which lies off the mouth of the principal
river of Sulu. There the earth had opened with a violent
commotion, and had vomited out flames mingled with trees and
huge stones. So great was the disturbance that the sea bottom
was mingled with the interior of the earth, and the volcano threw
out quantities of shells and other things that grow upon the bottom
of the sea. The mouth of this volcano remained open afterward.
It was very broad, and the eruption had burned up everything
upon the island. But what excited the greatest amazement
was that a third volcano broke out on the same day and hour with
the two just mentioned, in the province of Ilocos, in Luzon, and
at least six hundred miles north; and this volcano ejected water.
The outbreak was preceded by a violent storm and earthquake.
The earth swallowed up three mountains, on the sides of one of
which were three villages. All three mountains were torn from
their foundations and blown into the air, together with a vast
amount of water, and the chasm which took their place formed a
broad lake, that showed no trace of the mountains which had
stood on the spot. The letter from which the foregoing account
is taken goes on to say that the noise of this outbreak, which occurred
between 9 and 10 <span class="smcap smaller">A. M.</span>, was heard not only in Manila
but in all the Philippine Islands and the Moluccas. It even
reached the mainland of Asia in the kingdoms of Cochin China,
Champa, and Cambodia, as was learned from priests and others
who came to Manila from those countries afterward. The noise
sounded like heavy artillery and musketry fire at two or three
leagues’ distance. In Manila it was supposed that the firing was
going on in Cavite, while at Cavite it was referred to Manila,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
and messengers were sent from one place to the other to make
inquiries, and a similar impression prevailed in all the islands,
cities, and villages in a circuit of nine hundred leagues, within
which the noise was heard. Malacca was taken by the Dutch on
the 13th of January, and was already hard pressed on the 4th, and
many pious Spaniards believed, after the news had come of the
capture of the place, that Heaven had taken this volcanic means
of warning them of the great injury which would result to the
archipelago from the loss of so important a city.</p>

<p>The missionaries in Cochin China gave January 5th as the
date of the outbreak, instead of the 4th, there being one day’s
difference between the reckoning of the Portuguese, who sailed
from west to east, and that of the Spaniards, who sailed from east
to west, to their Eastern possessions.</p>

<p>The volcano of Mayon, or Albay, in the province of Camarines,
has been in frequent eruption from 1616 down to within
thirty years. Some of the eruptions were very destructive to life
and property. After an activity in July, 1766, of six days’ duration,
accompanied by a great flow of lava, on October 23, 1766,
during a violent storm, which began at about 7 <span class="smcap smaller">P. M.</span> from
north-northwest and at 3 <span class="smcap smaller">A. M.</span> suddenly veered to the south and
blew down all the houses of one of the villages in the neighborhood,
the volcano ejected such a vast quantity of water that
several torrents of thirty varas (ninety feet) wide ran down to the
sea between the villages Tibog and Albay. Between Bacacay and
Malinao the floods were over eighty varas (two hundred and forty
feet) wide, and the highways were obliterated. One village was
entirely destroyed, nearly all the houses of the region were swept
away, and the fields were covered with sand; another village was
partly destroyed, its remainder forming an island, or rather a hill,
surrounded by deep, broad ravines, through which the stream of
sand and water ran. In another place palms and other trees were
buried in sand to their tops. Some fifty persons lost their lives.
As far as could be judged, the account declares, this [cold?] water
came from the interior of the volcano, while we should be inclined
to regard it as a cloudburst. The outbreak of February 1, 1814,
however, was the most destructive of all. An eyewitness writes
that at about 8 <span class="smcap smaller">A. M.</span> the mountain suddenly threw out a thick
column of stones, sand, and ashes, which quickly rose to the highest
layers of the air. The sides of the volcano became veiled and
disappeared from the view of the spectators, while a stream of fire
ran down the mountain and threatened to annihilate them. Every
one fled to the highest attainable point for safety, while the roar
of the volcano struck terror into all. The darkness increased,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
and many of the fleeing ones were struck down by the falling
stones. Houses afforded no protection, because the red-hot stones
set them on fire, and the most flourishing villages of the Camarines
were thus laid in ashes. Toward 10 <span class="smcap smaller">A. M.</span> the rain of stones ceased,
and was replaced by one of sand, and at about 2 <span class="smcap smaller">P. M.</span> the noise
had lessened and the sky began to clear. Twelve thousand persons
were killed and many wounded by this eruption. After the
mountain had become quiet it presented a frightful appearance,
its former picturesque, highly cultivated slopes being covered with
barren sand, which enveloped the cocoanut trees to their tops, and
some one hundred and twenty feet of its summit had been carried
away during the eruption. An enormous opening had been formed
on its southern side, near which three other mouths appeared, which
continued to emit ashes and smoke. The finest villages of the
Camarines were destroyed, and the best part of the province was
converted into a sandy waste.</p>

<p>This mountain has been active at short intervals down to the
present time. Sometimes its activity has been continuous for a
year or more. Its eruptions were frequently accompanied by
earthquakes and storms. The next outbreak after that described
above was in 1827. In 1834 and 1835 the mountain was active
nearly all the time. There was no eruption of ashes, but every
night a stream of molten lava could be seen running into the higher
ravines. In 1845 there was an eruption of ashes which lasted several
days; a violent eruption occurred in 1846, two unimportant
ones in 1851, and another violent ash and stone eruption occurred
on July 27, 1853, during which thirty-one persons were killed.
Others occurred in 1855, 1857, 1858, 1859, 1860, 1865, and 1871.
The heights of the Philippine volcanoes vary from ten thousand
and nine thousand feet (Albay or Mayon) down to Taal, only
seven hundred and eighty feet high. This curious volcano is upon
an islet in the middle of Lake Bombon, south of Manila. Lake
Bombon was originally probably a vast crater. It is separated
from the China Sea by a narrow isthmus. Taal contains secondary
craters, crevasses emitting vapors, and lakelets of acid water.
It is the principal “show” volcano of the islands, and was in
action in 1885, when all the vegetation upon the island was burned
up. Lake Bombon was doubtless formerly connected with the sea,
the intervening barrier being formed of eruptive <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">scoriæ</i>. Its water
is still saline, and its marine fauna has adapted itself to its modified
environment.</p>

<p>On the small island Camiguin, on the northwest coast of Mindanao,
is the extinct volcano Catarman, with a crater lake upon its
summit whose level has been subject to great fluctuations. Sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
the lake dried up, and again it has overflowed and inundated
the low lands in the neighborhood, as in 1827 and 1862. Often
its water has been set boiling by escaping gases. It would be interesting
to know what varying pressure caused the changes in the
level of this lake on the top of Mount Catarman.</p>

<p>A further idea of the volcanic activity of this region may be
gained from the circumstance that a volcanic island emerged from
the sea on the north coast of Luzon in 1856, which grew to seven
hundred feet in height by 1860, and is now about eight hundred
feet high. Every one has seen photographs of the streets of Manila
after an earthquake, which form of subterranean activity is
so common that it is taken into account in building.</p>

<h2 title="THE SCAVENGERS OF THE BODY" id="scavengers">THE SCAVENGERS OF THE BODY.<br />

<span class="subhead small notbold"><span class="smcap">By M. A. DASTRE.</span></span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">The</span> labors of M. Metchnikoff have made known one of the
most curious mechanisms&mdash;perhaps the most effective&mdash;which
Nature employs to protect the organism against the invasion and
ravages of microbes. We are only beginning to learn the means
which are provided for our defense against the countless swarms
of enemies of this class, some of them exceedingly dangerous,
among which we have to live and move. In the first rank of these
defenses is phagocytosis. The struggle of the organism against its
minute assailants is an image of human wars. The cutaneous or
mucous integument, continuous over the whole body, constitutes a
kind of fortified inclosure which the microbe can not penetrate, except
where some breach has been made. On one side of that wall,
in the living city, the phagocytes or leucocytes (white cells) form
an immense defensive army in a state of continual mobilization, or,
as M. Duclaux would say, an innumerable and vigilant police.</p>

<p>These phagocytes or leucocytes are the nomadic elements of our
economy. The animal body may be compared to an organized
city in which all the living corpuscles, all the cellular elements, are
sedentary, each having its place and staying there. Hence the
comparison, often made, with the stones of a building, which is not
exact, however, because these vital elements grow and increase,
enlarging the structure without change of arrangement, while the
stones do not. The growth and nutrition of these anatomical elements,
it should be added, are carried on exclusively at the expense
of liquid matters. Nothing solid can enter them or come out
from them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
An exception to these two fundamental rules is found in the
single case of the leucocytes or white globules of the blood. They
have no fixed or determined place in the organism. Besides being
carried passively by the flow of the blood in a perpetual circulation
along with the red corpuscles, they possess a motion of their
own. They can swim in the current that carries them, fix themselves
to the walls, and travel in a sort of creeping way, which has
been called the amœboid motion.</p>

<p>They are also exceptions to the second law, according to which
living cells can dispose only of liquefied matters. All solid bodies
that pass within reach of the leucocytes are seized and incorporated
by them, provided they are small or inert enough to be enveloped.
The nature of the body is of little import. Whatever it may be,
it is swallowed and quickly inclosed within the mass of the leucocyte
and submitted to the dissolving action of its juices&mdash;or, in a
way, eaten. Hence the names “phagocyte,” or devouring cell, given
to the enveloping white globule, and “phagocytosis” to the process.
No other element of the organism, or hardly any other, possesses
this singular faculty of seizure and swallowing (<i>inglobement</i>).</p>

<p>All the other characteristics of the white globules flow from
these two of mobility and phagocytism, the significance of which
has been set in a clear light by M. Metchnikoff. These characteristics
are the attributes of the most primitive types of animal life.
They appertain to cells not yet differentiated, to the unicellular
organisms which occupy the first stages of life. They translate
the vital energy of elements still independent and isolated, without
definite place in the social organization and as yet without special
high function, but for that very reason better adapted to the
needs of the simplest animality. Their voracity is useful for the
preservation of the social organism. By eliminating old, exhausted,
diseased cells they rejuvenate the structure and prepare
the way for new generations. And when the fecundity of these is
exhausted the leucocytes come in to occupy the vacated situations,
and conduct the organism thus patched up through a senile degeneracy
to natural death.</p>

<p>The leucocytes, white globules, or phagocytes, by virtue of their
mobility, are found everywhere&mdash;in the blood, in all the organs,
and in all parts of the body&mdash;but are perhaps most abundant in
the blood. The study of them proceeds slowly, and we are still
engaged in distinguishing the varieties among them. The most
abundant and best known of them&mdash;those which answer most closely
the description we have given&mdash;are those called the polynuclear,
neutrophilous leucocytes. They are colored with neutral hues,
and have a nucleus like a rolled-up scroll in structure. Other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
varieties&mdash;the eosinophiles, lymphocytes, etc.&mdash;are less mobile and
have still less marked phagocytic properties.</p>

<p>The roll-call of the phagocytic army would be a long task. The
phagocytes are numerous in the sanguineous fluid, but are still six
hundred and fifty times less so than the red corpuscles. They are
almost as numerous in the lymph and the conjunctival tissue, where,
besides occurring in their normal condition, they sport into a variety
which appears to have abandoned its migratory habit, for a time at
least, and into a giant variety one hundred times larger than the
ordinary leucocytes, which M. Ranvier calls clasmatocytes. They
are further found in such tissues as the skin and the mucous membrane,
where, notwithstanding the cells are so crowded, they make
their way into the intestine, and, by a sort of diapedesis (passage
through the pores or interstices) called the phenomenon of Stoehr,
toward all the free surfaces, whither exterior soluble substances
invite them. As they go they destroy the microbes which, advancing
in an inverse direction, would invade the organism and
provoke an infection of intestinal origin.</p>

<p>The fact that this immense army of phagocytes is always in
motion was first clearly recognized by Cohnheim, in 1867. He
saw, in inflamed regions, where the vessels are gorged and distended,
the white globules thrusting out a prolongation which
seemed to pierce the wall, but in reality simply insinuated itself
between its elements, and elongating itself, drew its entire body,
as it were, through the narrow channel. This emigration, which
is produced without making a break, through the pores and interstices
of the vascular wall, has been designated <i>diapedesis</i>. It is
ordinarily provoked by some foreign body, a pathogenic microbe,
for instance, which has introduced itself into the place and spread
its irritating secretion or cause of infection there. The phagocytes,
attracted from the interior of the vessel, come up and devour
the invader. But if they are incapable of dissolving it they
bear it away to work their own ruin; they degenerate in their
turn, become transformed into globules of pus, and the inflammation
results in purulence. The study of the mechanism by means
of which the leucocytes traverse the tissues is very interesting.</p>

<p>These remarkable wandering elements are found in all classes
of animals, and in all present the same essential characteristics.
They are more like free existences than the other cells living in
society which compose the bodies of animals, and their history is
substantially like that of the naked one-celled organisms. Their
various functions and properties are of the highest interest in all
departments of physiology. It has been demonstrated, in particular,
that the white globules of the blood give rise to the most energetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
and most special agencies of living chemistry, to the ferments
which determine the coagulation of the blood when drawn from
the vessels (coagulating ferment, or thrombosis) and the consumption
of sugar (glycolytic ferment), and to numerous diastases. The
presence of nuclein in their bodies involves consequences which
we are only beginning to perceive.</p>

<p>Behaving like independent beings, the leucocytes or phagocytes
perform similar functions with those of the highest animals, feeding,
respiring, and reproducing themselves; they move and feel&mdash;that
is, are impressed by internal excitants. These operations, however,
assume with them a character of extreme simplicity. They
seem to be the direct result of the physical and chemical properties
of the protoplasm that composes them, so that the mysterious
side of those vital functions nearly vanishes when we scan them in
these their very beginnings. Their respiration is the effect of a sort
of affinity between their substance and the vital gas&mdash;a chimiotactism
directing them toward oxygen. This may be illustrated by
forming a microscopic preparation of fresh lymph, imprisoning a
few bubbles of air, and sealing it hermetically with paraffin.
After two or three hours we can see the leucocytes grouped around
the bubbles. When the provision of air is exhausted, several hours
afterward, the leucocytes will cease to move and become inert.
On inserting a needle, the contact of the air revives them.</p>

<p>The faculty possessed by the leucocytes of seizing solid corpuscles
coming in contact with them, inglobing them, and absorbing
them, or, as M. Metchnikoff calls it, intracellular digestion or
phagocytosis, is easily observed. If we mix fine granulations of
carmine or cinnabar, mingled with slightly salted water, with a
drop of lymph, we can see the coloring matter penetrating the leucocytary
protoplasmic mass, which is soon stuffed with it. The
anatomo-pathologists had already observed, in tattooed subjects,
white globules charged with grains of charcoal or vermilion. It
is legitimate to conclude that some parts of the coloring matter
that had been introduced under the epidermis had been taken up
by the white globules. This proceeding has been observed in the
very act by M. Metchnikoff.</p>

<p>A classic experiment illustrating this operation is now common
in our laboratories, and the fact of phagocytosis has come to be
regarded as incontestable.</p>

<p>The generality of the phenomenon results from the leucocyte
preserving its phagocytic faculty in all its peregrinations, and these
peregrinations are unlimited. The tendency of the nomadic elements
to push on and insinuate themselves into the finest interstices
and the narrowest passages is a rudiment of a tactile sense,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>
to this extent simply a physical phenomenon, which MM. Mascart
and Bordet have clearly distinguished. As soon as a leucocyte
touches a resisting body it reacts to the contact by applying the
largest possible surface to it. It spreads out, becomes thin,
stretches itself along, and ceases deforming itself only after it has
obtained the maximum of contact. By such mechanism it penetrates
objects that offer it any breach and overcomes them. When
the foreign body has been disaggregated into fragments, into small
enough grains, phagocytosis intervenes and disposes of the remains.
In this way the organism sometimes rids itself of splinters of bone
that remain in the tissues after a fracture. So, too, the leucocytes,
when occasion arises, repair the blunders of surgeons by extracting
and absorbing forgotten objects left in wounds, while at other
times they act as auxiliaries by destroying things that have been
voluntarily abandoned in them, like threads of catgut in buried
sutures and drains of decalcified bone.</p>

<p>There are two conditions, under normal circumstances, in which
phagocytosis plays a marked part. The first is the case where
vital action brings on the destruction of the organs or the tissues,
or, to use exact language, their disintegration in a solid form.
The wastes of organic activity are usually in liquid form, and,
turned into the blood, they are eliminated in that state through
the natural emunctories. Sometimes, however, disintegration results
in solid wastes, and the phagocytes do the work of carrying
them away. This is the case with the red globules of the blood,
which, after a longer or shorter career, are deposited in the spleen
and break up into <i>débris</i>, some of the parts of which are insoluble
in the interstitial liquids. The leucocytes collect around these residues
so thickly as sometimes to fuse themselves into a solid mass, a
sort of plasmodium or giant cell which digests the <i>débris</i>. At other
times, and more rarely the isolated leucocytes are not able to absorb
the incorporated matters. They then conduct them to the surface
of the intestine and discharge them there. A like phenomenon
occurs in the liver. The coloring matter of the blood frequently
gives rise to insoluble ferruginous deposits which the leucocytes
have to convey to the digestive tube. This occurs when a wound
provokes an effusion of blood and a mortification of the red globules
or of the neighboring anatomical elements. All of the waste that
can not take the liquid form and pass in that condition into the
circulatory passages is incorporated within the phagocytes. The
mechanism of resorption of bone does not seem different.</p>

<p>The phagocytes perform a similar function in another process
which very frequently takes place in various animals that pass
through metamorphoses, as in insects whose organs are transformed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
in changing from one stage of their existence to another, and in
tadpoles which lose their tails in becoming frogs; the old parts that
disappear are devoured by phagocytes.</p>

<p>Especially in the case of infectious diseases has the protective
part performed by the leucocytary phagocytes been brought into
full view by M. Metchnikoff. He has shown that the white globules
rush to meet the bacterides of inflammation that are introduced
through any wound, absorb them, and render them powerless to
do harm. In the lymphatic organs&mdash;the spleen, the lymphatic
ganglions, and the marrow&mdash;the white globules are normally accumulated,
and there is where the struggle is most active between
the bacterides of inflammation which are swarming in the blood
and the defensive agents of the organism. The same takes place
with the spirilla of recurrent typhus and the microbe of erysipelas.</p>

<p>The leucocytes are capable of adapting themselves to conditions
different from those in which they usually live, provided the change
is not too abrupt. It may sometimes occur that the poison secreted
by a microbe will paralyze and kill the leucocyte, unless care has
been taken, by inoculations of virus, at first attenuated and afterward
gradually increasing in virulence, to create an immunity in
the phagocyte, to make it refractory to the poison and capable of
swallowing the toxic bacterium without suffering from it. Explanations
have been sought in this property for the virtue of vaccination
and the immunity that results from it, but they are evidently
only fragmentary, and there are other theories of immunity.</p>

<p>The leucocytes are not always victorious over the microbes,
and when these excel in numbers or force it sometimes comes to
pass that they are overcome and succumb. Poisoned by the substance
they have incorporated, they undergo a fatty degeneration
and become globules of pus. Pus is therefore formed of the cadavers
of conquered leucocytes. Although that humor ought, for
the good of the system, to be rejected, like every other mortified
part, it is nevertheless true that the production of it is a beneficent
effort, and a salutary reaction of Nature against the morbid agent.</p>

<p>It will be an enduring honor to the name of M. Metchnikoff
that he has revealed the importance of the function of phagocytes,
and has enriched science with a large number of new truths. A part
of this honor will be reflected upon the Pasteur Institute, which has
welcomed the eminent biologist for many years, and has intrusted
the direction of one of its services to him. The learned Russian,
in creating the study of phagocytism, with its causes, mechanism,
and consequences, has opened a very extensive field of research to
which we have given only a distant and cursory glance.&mdash;<i>Translated

<h3><i>LIBERAL EDUCATION AND DEMOCRACY.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">In</span> a most thoughtful article, in
the Modern Education Series of
The Cosmopolitan, President Hadley,
of Yale, remarks that the
conception of a liberal education
changes as forms of government
change. “It takes one shape,” he
proceeds to say, “in a military
state, and quite another shape in a
state ruled by public opinion. In
the former case it will teach the
sterner virtues of courage and pride.
In the latter case it will teach respect
for law, progressiveness, and
human sympathy. But in either
case a liberal education is an education
for citizenship; a development
of those distinguishing qualities
moral, intellectual, and physical
by which the people are to be ruled.”</p>

<p>It is a happy definition of “a
liberal education” to say that it
is “an education for citizenship.”
From this point of view the <i>most</i>
liberally educated man will be he
who is educated to be a citizen of
the world and to feel his relation
not only to the present but to the
past, and the future as well. Comte
had much the same idea when he
taught that the moral and social
education of the individual was accomplished
first by the family, then
by the state, and finally by the race.
In other words, the egoism of the
individual is first tamed by family
life, then broadened by political
life, and, lastly, humanized in the
full sense by conscious participation
in the age-long progress of
mankind. President Hadley has
well chosen the qualities which he
says a liberal education under a
democracy should aim at developing,
but we think he might with
much advantage have added another.
He will remember that
when the poet Horace would describe
the character of a high-principled
citizen, a man just and firm
of purpose, he says that his mind is
shaken neither by the lowering
countenance of a tyrant nor by the
frenzy of the populace commanding
vicious courses of policy. In
our land and time the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vultus instantis
tyranni</i> is no longer, if it
ever was, an object of terror, but
the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">civium ardor prava jubentium</i> is
a danger, we fear, which has yet to
be reckoned with.</p>

<p>In a state, therefore, which is
ruled by public opinion one of the
qualities which a liberal education
should most distinctly aim to impart
is firmness to resist popular
pressure when exerted in a wrong
direction. In like manner, under
an aristocracy a truly liberal education
would not be one that would
tend to perpetuate in the rising
generation the faults of the preceding
one, or to shut out all criticism
of the established <i>régime</i>; on the
contrary, its tendency should be to
temper whatever was extreme or
one-sided in the views of the ruling
class. The liberality of an education
comes in just here, in opening
out wider views than would probably
be acquired in actual contact
with private business or public affairs.
When William Pitt, while
Prime Minister of England, betook
himself to the study of Adam
Smith’s recently published Wealth
of Nations, and began to consider
how he could apply the enlightened
and philosophical views contained
therein to the fiscal policy of the
British Empire, he was converting
his old-fashioned liberal education
into a liberal education of the best
kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
A liberal education, let it be
thoroughly understood, is not one
which delivers over an individual to
the dominant influences of his place
and time, whatever they may be,
but one which enables him to react,
when necessary, against such influences
under the guidance of wider
views and deeper principles. It is
an <i>illiberal</i> education, let it embrace
what it may, which simply
equips a man for exploiting for his
own benefit the conditions and tendencies
which he finds prevailing in
the society around him; and too
much of what passes for liberal
education has, we fear, had no better
result. In a country like ours,
liable to be swept by gusts of popular
excitement, not to say passion,
the aim of all higher education
should be to create a class of citizens
trained for social influence,
and yet able to stand on their guard
against sensational politics, to distinguish
between true and false patriotism,
and to uphold the claims
of justice and honor when threatened
by popular infatuation and
tumult. We read in Thucydides
that Cleon, the typical demagogue
of ancient Athens, did not hesitate
to tell his fellow-citizens that republics
were not adapted for holding
distant territories in subjection.
If Cleon was a demagogue,
what are we to think of the highly
educated men who in our country
echo the popular cry for an imperial
policy, and say that millions
of people beyond sea who ask only
for liberty should be compelled by
force of arms to be our subjects?
Let our colleges and universities see
to it that they understand “a liberal
education” in the right sense.</p>

<h3><i>EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL AGGRESSION.</i></h3>

<p>Much surprise has been expressed
at the unusual prevalence of violence
of all kinds in the United
States during the past year. It has
seemed quite extraordinary that in
a nation devoted, as the American
nation is, to vast schemes of philanthropy
at home and abroad, such
atrocious crimes as the mutilation
and burning of negroes and the explosion
of dynamite under street
cars should be committed. From
the sympathetic and self-sacrificing
spirit manifested in the enthusiastic
response to the appeal to arms to
free Cuba and Puerto Rico from
Spanish cruelty and despotism, and
the repression of the insurrection in
the Philippine Islands for the purpose
of introducing order and civilization,
something quite different
was expected. There should have
been a deeper interest in the welfare
of the negro and a greater effort to
protect him in the enjoyment of his
rights. There should have been created
a tie between capital and labor
that no differences about wages or
hours of toil could have ruptured
with murderous animosities. In a
word, there should have been a manifestation
of fraternal feeling among
all classes and in all sections that
would have advanced the United
States a long step toward the goal of
civilization. So general has been
the anticipation of these fruits from
the war with Spain that one of the
most familiar arguments in favor of
it has been the subjective regeneration
that would follow the attempt
at objective regeneration. That is
to say, the American people were to
find a cure for their own moral disorders
in their cure of the moral disorders
of their neighbors.</p>

<p>To a student of the social philosophy
of Herbert Spencer it will
be no surprise nor disappointment
that this expectation, so worthy of
a generous and self-sacrificing people,
has not been and is not likely
to be realized. No truth set forth
in his works is more firmly established
than his profound induction
that external aggression always begets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
internal aggression&mdash;that assaults
upon the rights of others
abroad leads to assaults upon the
rights of others at home. “As it
is incredible,” he says, “that men
should be courageous in the face of
foes and cowardly in the face of
friends, so it is incredible that other
feelings fostered by perpetual conflicts
abroad should not come into
play at home. We have just seen,”
he adds, alluding to the proofs of
this truth that he has given, “that
with the pursuit of vengeance outside
the society there goes the pursuit
of vengeance inside the society,
and whatever other habits of
thought and action constant war
necessitates must show their effects
on social life at large.” The facts
in support of Mr. Spencer’s generalization
are to be found in the history
of every militant people. He
mentions himself the Fijian’s sacrifice
of their own people at their cannibal
festivals, and the prevalence
of assassination among the Turks
from the earliest times down to the
present. He mentions also the hideous
acts of cruelty that are to be
found in the records of Greek and
Roman civilization. To these examples
may be added the atrocities
committed by Italians upon Italians
during the last days of the mediæval
republics, and those committed
by Frenchmen upon Frenchmen
during the French Revolution.
“The victories of the Plantagenets
in France,” said Goldwin Smith,
pointing out not long ago the futility
of war as a cure for national
factiousness, “were followed by insurrections
and civil wars at home,
largely owing to the spirit of violence
that the raids in France excited.
The victories of Chatham
were followed by disgraceful scenes
of cabal and faction, as well as corruption,
terminating in the prostration
of patriotism and the domination
of George III and North.”</p>

<p>It is impossible to hope that the
United States can be an exception
to the social law thus established.
However pure the motive that may
lie at the bottom of a war of aggression,
it can not annul the law. The
shedding of blood and the seizure
of territory produce a callousness of
feeling and a perverted view of the
rights of others that are certain to
turn the hands striking a foreign
foe to the work of domestic strife.
Already we have seen with what bitterness
such men as Prof. Charles
Eliot Norton and Mr. Edward Atkinson
have been assailed. We have
seen, too, how attempts have been
made to discredit the principles of
the Declaration of Independence,
and to show that the Constitution
must not be permitted to stand in
the way of what has been politely
called the fulfillment of the destiny
of the United States. We have
seen, finally, how proposals for the
disfranchisement of American citizens
have been listened to in all
parts of the country with a toleration
that must cause the old abolitionists
to turn in their graves. But
the spirit thus manifested has not,
we may be sure, failed to contribute
to the perpetration of the outrages
that have shocked every right-minded
observer of current events. It
is not a difference of kind but only
one of degree that separates the
slaughter of Spaniards in Cuba and
Tagals in Luzon from the slaughter
of negroes in the South and the explosion
of dynamite under street
cars in the North. The inhuman instincts
that impel to the one impel
to the other.</p>

<p><b>Zola’s Anthropological Traits.</b>&mdash;Mr.
Arthur MacDonald has published,
originally in the Open Court, a minute
anthropological study of the personality
of Émile Zola. Passing all the physical
points noted, we select a few only of
the most peculiar mental traits mentioned
by the author. Fear is spoken
of as Zola’s principal emotion, connected
in him with the instinct of self-preservation.
He is not much afraid of the
bicycle, but shrinks from a ride through
a forest at night. He has no fear of
being buried alive, yet sometimes when
in a tunnel on a railroad train he has
been beset with the idea of the two ends
of the tunnel falling in and burying
him. Some morbid ideas have developed
in him, but they do not cause him
pain when not satisfied. He lets them
run into their “manias,” and is then contented.
The idea of doubt is one. He
is always in fear of not being able to
do his daily task, or of being incapable
of completing a book. He never rereads
his novels, for fear of making
bad discoveries. He has an arithmetical
mania, and when in the street he counts
the gas jets, the number of doors, and
especially the number of hacks. In his
home he counts the steps of the staircases,
the different things on his bureau.
He must touch the same pieces of furniture
a certain number of times before
he goes to sleep. Some numbers have
a bad influence for him, and there are
good numbers. In the night he opens
his eyes seven times, to prove that he
is not going to die. He is regarded by
the author as a neuropath, or a man
whose nervous system is painful but
does not seem to affect the soundness
of his mind. “In brief, the qualities
of Zola are fineness and exactitude
of perception, clearness of conception,
power of attention, sureness in judgment,
sense of order, power of co-ordination,
extraordinary tenacity of effort,
and, above all, a great practical utilitarian
sense.”</p>

<p><b>The Simplon Tunnel.</b>&mdash;The following
facts are taken from a brief account
of this great engineering feat in the Engineering
Magazine: There is at present
no direct rail connection between
western Switzerland and Italy, and to
reach Milan it has been necessary to go
around to Lucerne and so on through
by the St. Gothard route. The distance
by rail from Milan to Calais by the
Mont Cenis is 665 miles, and by the St.
Gothard 680 miles. The distance by
way of the Simplon Tunnel will be only
585 miles. The Jura-Simplon Railway
from Geneva around the lake and up the
Rhone Valley ascends to Brieg at an
altitude of about 2,300 feet, while on the
Italian side the railway from Milan
stops at Domodossola, at an altitude of
900 feet. Between the two, which are
41 miles apart and over an elevation of
6,590 feet, lies the famous Simplon Pass.
Connection is now made by diligence,
the trip occupying a whole day. The
plan of the new railway includes the
prolongation of the present line on the
Italian side to Iselle, at an altitude of
about 2,100 feet, where the Italian entrance
to the tunnel was begun in August,
1898. On the Swiss side the entrance
is at Brieg, and the tunnel will
connect these two towns, being 12.26
miles long. This is nearly three miles
longer than the St. Gothard, but the
altitude is only 2,300 feet above the sea,
instead of 3,800 feet, as at the St. Gothard.
The tunnel is to be straight laterally,
but higher in the middle than at
either end, the grade being 1 in 143 on
the Italian and 1 in 500 on the Swiss
side. The principal difference between
the Simplon Tunnel and those previously
pierced through the Alps is that, instead
of one single tunnel, two separate
tunnels, fifty-five feet apart, are to be
constructed, connected by lateral passageways
every 650 feet. At first but
one of these is to be completed to the
full dimensions, the other being carried
through at only about a quarter of the
ultimate cross-section, and not enlarged
and put into use until the traffic demands
it. Both tunnels are now being
bored by the use of the Brandt hydraulic
rotary drills, water being supplied at
a pressure of 70 to 100 atmospheres.
The borings are through gneiss, limestone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
and slate. Holes two inches and
three quarters in diameter and four or
five feet deep are bored and the rock
dislodged by means of dynamite. A narrow-gauge
railway is used to remove the
<i>débris</i>. It is expected that the tunnel
will be completed in five years and a
half. At the close of 1898, 300 feet had
been penetrated on the south side and
1,300 on the north. The estimated cost
of the complete double-track tunnels is
69,000,000 francs. This does not include
the construction of the permanent way.
The Mont Cenis Tunnel cost 75,000,000
francs, and the St. Gothard 59,750,000
francs. The work is practically controlled
by the Jura-Simplon Railway.</p>

<p><b>Grant Allen.</b>&mdash;The death of our
contributor, Mr. Grant Allen, was mentioned
in the last number of the Popular
Science Monthly. Mr. Allen was
born in February, 1848, the son of the
Rev. J. A. Allen, of Wolfe Island, Canada.
He attended schools in the United
States, in France, and in Birmingham,
England, and entered Merton College,
Oxford, whence he took his degree of
B. A. in 1870. He afterward spent a
few years in Jamaica as principal of a
college for the higher education of the
negro, which had only a brief career.
He returned to England and settled
down in London for literary work, writing
rather on social and scientific than
political subjects, for various journals.
While he loved and appreciated scientific
truth, he rather regarded his subject
from the æsthetic side, and this gave a
peculiar charm to his articles. He published
books on Physiological Æsthetics
and The Color Sense, which did not
prove profitable. Finding it hard to
gain a livelihood from his scientific
work, he turned to fiction, and soon
found, as the London Times has it,
“that his worst fiction was more profitable
than his best science.” His love of
science, however, “approached enthusiasm,”
and he contributed frequent popular
scientific articles to the magazines,
so that “for years past hardly one of
those publications has been reckoned
complete” without contribution of this
character from him. He removed from
London to Dorking, and afterward went
to southern France and Italy for his
health. Then, having so far recovered
that he could spend his winters in England,
he made himself a home at Hindhead,
Surrey. Here he died, October
25th, after several weeks’ suffering from
a painful internal malady. Among his
scientific works, his books on Physiological
Æsthetics, The Color Sense, and
the Evolution of the Idea of God deserve
special mention.</p>

<p><b>Japanese Paper.</b>&mdash;The peculiar
qualities of Japanese paper, most of
them excellent ones, and the great variety
of uses to which it is applied, are
known everywhere. It is a wood or
bark paper, and derives its properties
from the substances of which it is made
and the method of its manufacture.
Several plants are cultivated for the
manufacture, which, in the absence of
English names, must be called by their
Japanese or scientific ones, of which
the principal are “mitsumata” (<i>Edgeworthia
papyrifera</i>), the “sozo” (<i>Brossonia
papyrifera</i>), and the “gampiju”
(<i>Wiekstroannia canecensis</i>). Bamboo
bark also furnishes a good paper, but is
not much used. The <i>mitsumata</i> ramifies
into three branches, and is cultivated
in plantations, being propagated
from seeds and by cuttings. It is fit
for use in the second year if the soil
is good. Its cultivation and exportation
have reached an enormous importance,
largely because the Imperial
Printing Office uses it for bank notes and
official documents. The <i>sozo</i> is propagated
by seeds, and somewhat resembles
the mulberry. The <i>gampiju</i> is a small
shrub which is cut in its third year.
To make paper, the bark is steeped in a
kettle with buckwheat ashes to extract
the resin in it. When it is reduced to
a pulp, a sieve-bottomed frame with silk
or hempen threads is plunged within,
very much as in Western paper-making.
This, letting out the water, holds the
pulp, which, felting, is to form the future
sheet of paper. This is pressed, to squeeze
all the water out, and is left to dry. The
uses made of paper in Japan are innumerable,
particularly in old Japan,
which treasures up its past. The papers,
though all made in a similar way,
are called by different names, according
to the uses to which they are applied
and their origin. Window lights are
made of paper, and partitions between
rooms, when it is stretched on frames,
which work as sliding doors. The celebrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
lanterns, called <i>gifu</i>, are made
of it at Tokio and Osaka. Under the
name of <i>shibuganni</i> it is applied to
the covering of umbrellas which are
sold in China and Korea. As <i>zedogawa
shi</i> bank notes are printed on it. Oiled
it is <i>kappa</i>, impermeable and suitable
for covering packages and for making
waterproof garments. Handkerchiefs
are made from it, cords by twisting.
For light, solid articles it is mixed
and compressed very much as our papier-maché.
Covered with thick paste and
pounded, it forms tapestries. Imitations
of Cordova leather are made of it by
spreading it and pressing it with hard
brushes upon boards in which suitable
designs have been cut. It is then covered
with oil and varnish. Japan produced
nearly five million dollars’ worth
of paper in 1892. Unfortunately, European
methods of manufacture have been
introduced, and there is danger of the
paper losing its distinctive qualities.</p>

<p><b>The Deeps of the Ocean.</b>&mdash;In his
geographical address at the British Association,
Sir John Murray showed that
the deep oceanic soundings are scattered
over the different ocean basins in
varying proportions, that they are now
most numerous in the North Atlantic
and Southwest Pacific, and in these
two regions the contour lines of depth
may be drawn with greater confidence
than in the other divisions of the great
ocean basins. On the whole, it may be
said that the general tendency of recent
soundings is to extend the area with
depths greater than one thousand fathoms,
and to show that numerous volcanic
cones rise from the general level
of the floor of the ocean basins up to
various levels beneath the sea surface.
Considerably more than half of the sea
floor lies at a depth exceeding two thousand
fathoms, or more than two geographical
miles. On the Challenger
charts all areas where the depth exceeds
three thousand fathoms have been
called “deeps,” and distinctive names
have been conferred upon them. Forty-two
such depressions are now known&mdash;twenty-four
in the Pacific Ocean, three
in the Indian Ocean, fifteen in the Atlantic
Ocean, and one in the Southern
and Antarctic Oceans. The area occupied
by these deeps is estimated at
7,152,000 geographical square miles, or
about seven per cent of the total water
surface of the globe. Within these
deeps more than 250 soundings have
been recorded, of which twenty-four exceed
2,000 fathoms, including three exceeding
5,000 fathoms. Depths exceeding
4,000 fathoms, or four geographical
miles, have been recorded in eight of
the deeps. Depths exceeding 5,000 fathoms
have been hitherto recorded only
within the Aldrich Deep of the South
Pacific, to the east of the Kermadecs
and Friendly Islands, where the greatest
depth is 5,155 fathoms, or 530 feet
more than five geographical miles. This
is about 2,000 feet more below the level
of the sea than the summit of Mount
Everest, in the Himalayas, is above it.</p>

<p><b>Death of Sir William Dawson.</b>&mdash;By
the death of Sir J. William Dawson,
at Montreal, November 19th, America
loses one of its most highly distinguished
geologists. Sir William was
born at Pictou, Nova Scotia, in October,
1820, and was deeply interested in the
study of Nature from his early college
days, when he made extensive collections
of various kinds. When he was
twenty-two years old a happy fortune
brought him in contact with Sir Charles
Lyell, then visiting America, and he
was that eminent geologist’s traveling
companion during his scientific tour of
Nova Scotia. He studied chemistry at
the University of Edinburgh. Returning
to Nova Scotia in 1850, he engaged
in teaching, and was associated with
the first normal school in the province.
He was afterward connected with the
new University of New Brunswick,
and from 1855 to 1893 was Principal of
McGill College and University. Although
his duties in the college were
very exacting, Professor Dawson’s industry
in scientific research was never
relaxed, and he was the author of contributions
of very great value to the
geology and paleontology of Canada.
Among these were the discoveries of the
<i>Dendrepeton acadianum</i>&mdash;the first reptile
found in the American coal formations&mdash;and
the <i>Pupa vetusta</i>&mdash;the first-known
Paleozoic land shell. His discovery
and exposition of the <i>Eozoon
canadense</i> attracted great attention,
and was much discussed, but his views
of its importance do not seem to have

<p><b>Glacial Lakes in New York.</b>&mdash;A
glacial lake is defined by H. P. Fairchild,
in his paper on Glacial Waters in
the Finger Lake Region of New York
(Geological Society of America, Rochester,
N. Y.), as a body of static water
existing by virtue of a barrier of ice.
Such impounded waters may exist where
a glacier blocks a stream, or where the
general land surface inclines toward the
glacier foot. The lakes described in Mr.
Fairchild’s paper belongs to the second
class, and were formed in the southern
part of the Ontario basin, where the
land slopes northward from a plateau
of two thousand feet elevation down to
Lake Ontario, two hundred and forty-six
feet. The high plateau was deeply
gashed by the preglacial stream erosion,
and in these trenches along the northern
border of the plateau lie the present
“Finger Lakes.” The topography was
peculiarly favorable to the production
against the bold ice front of a series of
distinct valley lakes, in many respects
unequaled elsewhere. Between twenty
and thirty of these lakes are described
in Professor Fairchild’s paper, which occupied
sites now partly represented by
nineteen streams and lakes, beginning
with Tonawanda Creek on the west and
extending to Butternut Creek (Jamesburg
and Apulia) on the east. The
local lakes were not of long duration,
and their surface level was unstable,
changing with the down-cutting of the
outlets and with the greatly increased
volume of the summer melting of the
ice sheet. Consequently, true beaches
are usually wanting. The conspicuous
evidences are the deltas of land streams,
with their terraces, embankments, bars
and spits, and the outlet channels. The
records of these extinct waters are the
very latest phenomena connected with
the ice invasion, and are the connecting
link between the glacial condition and
the present hydrography. They are of
lively interest, perhaps, to only a few
persons, but the details are necessary to
the more general study of the Pleistocene.
No economic or practical result
from the knowledge is foreseen, “but as
pure science the study of these waterless
lakes, waveless shores, and streamless
channels has a fascination and romance.”</p>

<p><b>The Environment In Education.</b>&mdash;“Two
considerations of equal and fundamental
importance,” says Mr. Wilbur
S. Jackman, “are included in teaching&mdash;the
choice of the subject-matter and its
presentation, and the reaction of the
pupil as the result of the presentation.
No presentation ever reaches consciousness
without a reaction, however feeble,
from which results an immediate and inevitable
corresponding mental construction.
Certain instincts called primitive,
it may be generally agreed, exist in children,
and, by taking intelligent advantage
of these, definite educative presentation
may be begun at a much earlier
age than was once supposed. Under the
theory that the child repeats the racial
history in its growth, a practice has
arisen of meeting the early instincts of
childhood with presentations from the
adult lives of primitive peoples. Presentations
are made to stimulate the idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
of hunting and fishing, of building wigwams
and the like.” But it is a fundamental
error, Mr. Jackman believes, to
suppose that while the child may be Indianlike
in his instincts he is to be considered
or treated as an Indian. Another
factor of which evolution makes a
great deal&mdash;the nature of the environment&mdash;must
be considered, and it is very
powerful. The material for satisfying
the cravings of the early instincts should
therefore be chosen from the immediate
environment, to which the pupil’s reaction
is at once positive and definite.
“It is scarcely possible to overmagnify
the benefits of an education that seeks
first to make the most out of the immediate
things of life. Its results and its
ideals are about us everywhere. The
ability to use in the most intelligent
and skillful way the materials of our
environment is the necessary condition
for the highest purposes and the most
glorified ideals. One must have a profound
respect for the education that proposes
to give us clean cities and hygienic
homes.”</p>

<p><b>An Athabascan Indian Lodge.</b>&mdash;The
caribou-skin lodge of the northern
Athabascan Indians is described by Mr.
Frank Russell, in his Explorations in
the Far North, as supported by a framework
of from twelve to thirty poles.
In pitching camp in winter, sticks are
thrust through the snow in order to find
solid earth for a floor. If the stick
enters soft moss the place is avoided,
as the camp fire would spread and undermine
the lodge. When a suitable
site is found, the men clear away the
snow with their snowshoes, and perhaps
assist the women in cutting and carrying
the lodge poles. It is the women’s
duty to carry bundles of spruce boughs
with which to cover the floor of the
lodge. The brush is carefully laid,
branch by branch, so that the stems are
under the tops and point away from the
center. This floor is renewed every Saturday
afternoon. The fireplace is surrounded
by a pole of green wood, three
or four inches in diameter, cut so as to
be bent in the form of a polygon. Above
the doorway a pole eight feet long is
lashed to the lodge-poles in a horizontal
position, six feet from the ground;
this, and a similar pole on the opposite
side, support from six to twelve poles,
crossing above the fire, making a stage
on which to thaw and dry meat. Each
hunter’s powder-horn and shot-pouch
are suspended from a lodge-pole or his
back, while his gun stands in its cover
against a pole or lies on a stage outside.
Near the door flap are several hungry
and watchful dogs, which, by constantly
running in and out, make an opening for
the cold wind to enter. The dogs are
tied at night. The side of the fire next
to the entrance is allotted to the children
and visiting women. On either side sit
the wives, for there are usually two
families in one lodge. Behind them are
<i>muskimoots</i> and an inextricable confusion
of rags, blankets, bones, meat, etc.
If a crooked knife, a tea bag, or anything
that is in the heap is needed, everything
is tumbled about until it is found.
The sled-wrapper is extended behind the
lodge-poles and serves as a catch-all for
stores of meat, bones to be pounded and
boiled to extract the grease, and odds
and ends not in constant use. The next
space is occupied by the men of the
house; that farthest from the door is
reserved for the young men and the men
guests. At night each adult rolls up in
a single three-point blanket or a caribou-skin
robe, and sleeps on an undressed
caribou skin. A piece of an old blanket
generally covers the small children in a
bunch.</p>

<p><b>The Sand Grouse.</b>&mdash;Pallas’s sand
grouse is a native of the Kirghiz steppes
of central Asia, and occasionally, driven
by some pressure of circumstances of
which we can only conjecture the nature,
makes visits to England. Its presence
in that country has never been recorded
till this century&mdash;more, perhaps,
for lack of observers than of migrating
birds&mdash;but it has appeared in 1863, 1872,
1873, 1888, 1889, and 1899. The principal
migration in recent years was in
1888, when many examples were seen
and shot in different parts of the country.
In the same year it was seen “far
and wide” in western Europe, and as
far north as Trondhjem, in western Norway.
A writer in the Saturday Review
remarks on the resemblance of this
sand grouse, as described by Prjevalski
in central Asia, to the various sand
grouse he has seen in South Africa. At
the drinking places they circle round
the water. Presently they alight and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
Prjevalski says, “hastily drink and rise
again, and, in cases where the flocks are
large, the birds in front get up before
those at the back have time to alight.
They know their drinking places very
well, and very often go to them from
distances of tens of miles, especially in
the mornings, between nine and ten
o’clock, but after twelve at noon they
seldom visit these spots.” In the Kalahari
country, at the scant desert waters,
the Saturday Review writer says, three
kinds of sand grouse “are to be seen
flocking in from all parts of the country
from eight to ten o’clock <span class="smcap smaller">A. M.</span> for their
day’s drink. Circling swiftly round the
pool with sharp cries, they suddenly
stoop together toward the water. The
noisy rustle of their wings as they alight
and ascend is most remarkable. We noticed
that the birds nearest the water
drank quickly and moved off, allowing
those in the rear to take their places
and slake their thirst, the whole process
being accomplished with unfailing
order and regularity.... The spectacle
of these punctual creatures, streaming
in from all points of the compass
with unfailing regularity between eight
and ten o’clock was always most fascinating.
After drinking they circled
once or twice round the water pool, and
then flew off with amazing swiftness for
their day of feeding in the dry, sun-scorched
desert. The seeds of grass and
other desert plants seem to constitute
their principal food. The sand grouse
has some characteristics of the pigeon
and some of the grouse, which suggest a
‘singular blending’ of the two orders.”</p>

<p><b>Plantations for Rural School
Grounds.</b>&mdash;A paper on the Laying out
and Adornment of Rural School Grounds,
by Prof. L. H. Bailey, published as a
Bulletin of Cornell University Experiment
Station, lays down as a general
principle in plantation that it should be
in the main for foliage effects. “Select
those trees and shrubs which are the
commonest, because they are the cheapest,
hardiest, and likeliest to grow. There
is no district so poor and bare that
enough plants can not be secured without
money for the school yard. You
will find them in the woods, in old
yards, along the fences.... Scatter in
a few trees along the fences and about
the buildings. Maples, basswood, elms,
ashes, buttonwood, pepperidge, oaks,
beeches, birches, hickories, poplars, a
few trees of pine or spruce or hemlock&mdash;any
of these are excellent. If the
country is bleak, a rather heavy planting
of evergreens about the border, in
the place of so much shrubbery, is very
good. For shrubs, use the common things
to be found in the woods and swales,
together with the roots which can be
found in every old yard. Willows, osiers,
witch-hazel, dogwood, wild roses, thorn
apples, haws, elders, sumac, wild honeysuckles&mdash;these
and others can be found
in every school district. From the farmyards
can be secured snowballs, spireas,
lilacs, forsythias, mock-oranges, roses,
snowberries, barberries, flowering currants,
honeysuckles, and the like. Vines
can be used to excellent purpose on the
outbuildings or on the schoolhouse itself.
The common wild Virginia creeper is
the most serviceable on brick or stone
schoolhouses. The Boston ivy or the
Japanese ampelopsis may be used, unless
the location is very bleak. Honeysuckle,
clematis, and bittersweet are also attractive.”
Flowers may be used for decorations.</p>

<p><b>Destruction of the Birds.</b>&mdash;A circular
sent us by the New York Zoölogical
Society opens with the declaration
which is only a moderate expression of
the truth, that “the annihilation of
the finest birds and quadrupeds of the
United States is a crime against civilization
which should call forth the disapproval
of every intelligent American.”
The second annual report of the society
(for 1897) contains an article on this
subject by Mr. William T. Hornaday,
which sets forth some remarkable facts
concerning the rate at which the destruction
of Nature’s fair creatures is
proceeding. It is not creditable to
American science or American manhood
that most of the measures that have
been adopted for the protection of animal
life in this country have been taken
in the interest and at the urgency of
sportsmen; or, to prevent killing the
poor creatures in an irregular way, in
order that they may be more conveniently
killed in the regular way. Mr.
Hornaday has a fairly satisfactory number
of reports in answer to his inquiries
concerning the rate at which birds
are disappearing from thirty-six States.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
From these he has compiled a graphic
table for thirty States, taking care to
keep within the conservative limit in
every particular, which shows that forty-six
per cent of the birds of the country
have been destroyed within the last
fifteen years&mdash;the State averages ranging
from ten per cent in Nebraska and
twenty-seven per cent in Massachusetts
to seventy-five per cent in Connecticut,
Indian Territory, and Montana,
and seventy-seven per cent in
Florida. In North Carolina, Oregon,
and California the balance of bird life
has been maintained; and in Kansas,
Wyoming, Washington, and Utah it has
increased&mdash;Kansas, with its law absolutely
forbidding traffic in certain birds,
being the “banner State.” “The western
part of the State of Washington
reveals the uncommon paradox of a locality
being filled up with bird forms
because of the clearing away of the timber.”
The agencies bringing about the
destruction of our animal life are many
and various. There are the “sportsmen,”
of whom Mr. Hornaday registers
five kinds, all eager to “kill something,”
hunting for one hundred and fifty-four
species of “game birds,” and when these
fail, taking the song birds in their place.
If the reports are true, the boys of
America are the chief destroyers of our
passerine birds and other small non-edible
birds generally. “The majority of
them shoot the birds, a great many devote
their energies to gathering eggs,
and some do both.” Then there are
the women wearing birds or feathers in
their hats. Egg collecting, which was
fostered at one time as encouraging interest
in natural history, has increased
till it has become an abuse as dangerous
and destructive as any of the others,
and even genuine scientific collectors are
advised to call a halt. Mr. Hornaday
concludes that “under present conditions,
and excepting in a few localities,
the practical annihilation of all our
birds, except the smallest species, and
within a comparatively short period,
may be regarded as absolutely certain
to occur.”</p>

<p><b>Annual Flowers.</b>&mdash;In a Cornell
University Agricultural Experiment bulletin
on Annual Flowers the authors,
G. N. Lauman and Prof. L. H. Bailey,
teach that the main planting of any
place should be trees and shrubs. The
flowers may then be used as decorations.
They may be thrown in freely
about the borders of the place, but not
in beds in the center of the lawn. They
show off better when seen against a
background, which may be foliage, a
building, a rock, or a fence. Where to
plant flowers is really more important
than what to plant. “In front of
bushes, in the corner of the steps, against
the foundation of the residence or outhouse,
along a fence or a walk&mdash;these
are places for flowers. A single petunia
plant against a background of foliage
is worth a dozen similar plants in the
center of the lawn.... The open-centered
yard may be a picture; the promiscuously
planted yard may be a nursery
or a forest. A little color scattered
here and there puts the finish to the
picture.” If the person wants a flower
garden, the primary question is one not
of decoration of the yard, but of growing
flowers for flowers’ sake. The flower
garden, therefore, should be at one side
of the residence or at the rear, for it is
not allowable to spoil a good lawn even
with flowers. A good small garden is
much more satisfactory than a poor
large garden. Many annual plants
make effective screens and covers for
unsightly places. Wild cucumber, cobœa,
and sweet peas may be used to decorate
the tennis screen or the chicken-yard
fence. Efficient screens can be made of
many strong-growing and large-leaved
plants, such as cannas, castor-beans,
sunflowers, or tobacco.</p>

<p><b>A Thirteenth-Century Miracle.</b>&mdash;The
legend of St. Prokopy relates that
on the 25th of June, 1290, the city of
Wilikij Ustjug, government of Vologda,
southern Russia, was imminently
threatened by a violent storm. The
populace appealed to the saint, and, by
virtue of his prayers, the storm changed
its direction, and, passing on one side
of the city, spent its fury upon a desert
spot about fifteen miles away, where it
left, with hail, a mass of fire-marked
stones, the fall of which wrought great
havoc with the undergrowth. The incident
made a deep impression upon the
minds of the people, so that the story is
still current and alive after the lapse
of six hundred years. A testimony to
what the people believe is its truth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
may be found by visiting the spot,
where a surface extending along about
four miles is covered with blocks of
stone, assumed to be meteorites. A
church dedicated to St. Prokopy has
been built in the neighboring village of
Loboff or Catoval, and near it stands a
curious little wooden chapel of great
antiquity, the foundation of which was
made of the stones that fell. The church
is decorated with pictures of St. Prokopy
and of incidents of the meteoric
storm, and one of the stones that fell
has been mounted on a pedestal in the
cathedral of Ustjug, where it is an object
of devotion. Mr. Melnikoff, Conservator
of the Mineralogical Collections
of the Mining Institute of St. Petersburg,
has examined the place and the
stones, and finds that they are not meteoric
and heavenly at all, but simply
earthly granite and sandstone. Yet M.
Stanislas Meunier suggests, in <i>La Nature</i>,
that the story, so carefully treasured
up for six hundred years, may have
a foundation. That such stones as lie
on the ground at Catoval may have been
taken up and transplanted by a tornado
of extreme violence he regards
as within the possibilities. M. Meunier
has himself investigated a phenomenon
of the kind in France, where the ground
was “mitrailled” with stones measuring
one, two, and three cubic centimetres,
which had been brought a distance
of one hundred and fifty kilometres.
Another possible explanation is that the
stones were already there, so concealed
by the dense growth as not to attract
particular attention, but became more
plainly obvious when the ground had
been cleared by the tornado.</p>

<p>While it recognizes the desirability
of agreeing upon some language as a
general medium of communication between
nations, the London Spectator
presents certain forcible reasons for not
seeking to institute one universal language.
“Mankind,” it says, “will never
adopt a universal language, nor is it to
be desired that it should. The instrument
for expressing thought must vary
with the character, history, and mental
range of those who have thoughts
to express, and if all men spoke alike,
ninety-nine per cent of them would be
speaking stiffly&mdash;not using, that is, a
natural and self-developed vehicle of expression.
Arabic could not have grown
up among Englishmen, or English
among Arabs. The seclusion of nations,
too, from one another by the want of
a common tongue is by no means all
loss, and we may doubt with reason
why the higher races would not be degraded
if they understood without effort
all that the lower races say to one
another. They would be bred, as it
were, in the servants’ hall, not to their
advantage.”</p>

<p>In a recent address on The Chemistry
of the Infinitely Little, M. Grimaux
referred to the fact, with which
all who have thought about it have
been struck, that pathogenic microbes
being diffused all through the atmosphere,
everybody must breathe and absorb
all sorts of them, including germs
of typhoid fever, scarlet fever, diphtheria,
etc., and yet we are not all attacked
with those diseases. Why? Because
each person has a peculiar temperament,
and cells adapted, to a greater
or less extent, to resist the microbe, to
destroy it when it enters the organism,
and thus constitutes, as the case may
be, a good or a bad cultural medium.
Every one, we might say, is immune
against some or other of the pathogenic
microbes. Like immunity belongs also
to certain animal species, and if a microbe
pathogenic to man or to some
other species is injected into them they
will resist it. The blood of refractory
animals probably contains principles not
yet known which oppose the development
of the infectious microbe. From
this fact the idea has been suggested of
injecting the blood of refractory animals
and communicating an artificial immunity
to the individual to whom the injection
is applied.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. J. Crépin</span>, of Paris, “an enthusiast
concerning the goat,” as M. de
Parville calls him in <i>La Nature</i>, has established
a model goat dairy, and is
endeavoring to diffuse a taste for goat’s
milk and its products. As a means to
this end, he has sought to procure an
improved breed of goats, and has obtained
a stock of very satisfactory quality
by crossing the best native goats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
with the Nubian buck. The latter animal
is rather awkward in form and
movement, but M. Crépin hopes to breed
that out. Otherwise the Nubian is well
acclimated, vigorous, and indifferent to
cold, hornless, and a most excellent
milker. Goat’s milk generally is richer
in caseine than cow’s milk, and owes
some of its special qualities to this fact,
and to the further circumstance that
the flecks of goat-milk cheese are smaller,
softer, and more easily broken up&mdash;consequently
more digestible&mdash;than
those of cow’s milk. Further, goat’s
milk is more nearly than any other
common milk like in composition to
human mother’s milk; and it has the
very great advantage that, the goat
being less subject to attacks of tuberculosis
and other dangerous disorders, it
is comparatively free from the liability
to convey infection. A single objection
to the general use of goat’s milk is the
odor which is supposed to be characteristic
of it, but M. Crépin affirms that
this is not apparent when the goats are
properly bred and kept. M. Crépin is
experimenting with butter from goat’s
milk, and represents that he finds it
very nice.</p>

<p>The fundamental principle involved
in the new form of telemeter, or instrument
for estimating the distance of
visible objects without actual measurement,
invented by Herr Zeiss, of Jena,
is that of the stereoscopic effect which
appears in natural vision, where the inclination
of the eyes in concentrating
on the object gives the sense of distance.
The base line between the eyes
is increased in the Zeiss instrument by
means of a system of prisms so as to
give a widened base of binocular vision,
and of mirrors which give magnifying
power. Double images are formed, the
distance between which varies in proportion
to the distance from the observer,
and appliances are provided for
measuring how far apart they are. The
arrangement is fairly satisfactory for
moderate distances&mdash;say of 3,000 metres,
or about 10,000 feet.</p>

<p>M. Moissan believes that he has
found a solution of the problem of the
manufacture of ammonia from the atmosphere,
and consequently of rendering
atmospheric nitrogen available in
agriculture, by the artificial production
of calcium nitride. While calcium undergoes
no change in contact with nitrogen
at the ordinary temperature, it
is affected by it under the operation of
heat, and finally burns in it, absorbing
it rapidly and giving rise to a bronze-colored
nitride. Thrown into water,
this substance decomposes with effervescence,
producing ammonia and calcium
hydrate.</p>

<p>Prof. A. E. Dolbear, of Tufts College,
Massachusetts, patented an invention
for telegraphing without wires in
1886, which he claims covers all that
Marconi is doing. He has sent messages
with it for as long distances as
five miles. According to his account he
invented the system and made successful
experiments with it as far back as
1882. He made an application for a
patent, which was rejected by the Patent
Office with the statement that it
was contrary to science and would not
work. “But as it did work, the claim
was maintained in the office, and four
years later, in 1886, a patent for it was
issued.” Professor Dolbear does not
wish it to be understood that his patent
is on the “art of wireless telegraphy,”

<p>On the occasion of the visit of the
French Association to the British Association,
Prof. J. J. Thomson gave an exposition
of the lines of research by
which it has been concluded that the
atom is not the smallest existing quantity
of matter. Electro-chemical phenomena
teach us to associate a definite
amount of electricity with each atom
of matter; but these recent researches
indicate that under certain circumstances
a much larger quantity of negative
electricity may be conveyed by the
atom, or else that the negative electrical
charge resides on a small detachable
portion of the “atom,” which alone
is concerned in the experiments. The
positive charge seems to be distributed
over the whole mass of the atom.</p>

<p>The merits of two methods of clarifying
sewage&mdash;by dilution and by bacterial
action&mdash;are discussed by Mr. Rudolph
Hering in articles in the Engineering
Magazine. Disposal by dilution
in large streams of water is regarded as
satisfactory in many places&mdash;where the
water of the stream is not to be used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
for drinking or cooking&mdash;provided the
flow of the stream is always copious
enough to dilute and disperse the sewage
so widely as to prevent putrefaction
and substitute oxidation. For purification
by bacterial action no single
method is found adapted to all conditions.
The method by filtration and
aëration is declared practicable only in
localities where a sufficient area of porous
land is available, upon which the
crude sewage can be spread in sufficient
quantity, into which it can filter with
the proper velocity, and from which it
can emerge as a thoroughly purified
water. Where these conditions are absent,
other methods must be adopted,
of which the experiments in artificial
filtration by tanks, as practiced at Exeter
and Sutton, England, are described.
These experiments promise to improve
the present method, but perhaps not as
greatly as is anticipated by the promoters.
The author regards a prior separation
of the suspended or dissolved
organic matter as essential to permanent
success when the amount of land is
limited.</p>

<p>By using the tuberculin test the faculty
of the Ohio Agricultural Experiment
Station have learned that in cattle
the tubercle bacillus usually first obtains
its foothold in some of the minor
glands, that it may exist there for
months and years before any other organs
are affected, and that it is only in
advanced cases that the lungs become
diseased. While the growth of the organism
is limited to these minor glands
the health of the animal usually shows
no sign of impairment. During this period
there is no evidence that any unwholesome
effect is being produced upon
the flesh, and so long as the infection
is localized in this way in one or two
organs the Government inspectors pass
the meat as sound. Tuberculosis, therefore,
is a very different complaint from
such diseases as pleuropneumonia or
Texas fever, in which the whole system
is saturated from the first instant with
the febrile symptoms.</p>

<h3>NOTES.</h3>

<p>Mr. James Weir tells of a spider
which stretched its web in the division
between two parts of a sawmill, where
the lower fastenings of the structure
were frequently broken by the repeated
passing of lumber through. Discovering
the situation, the insect gave up the
use of guy threads, and, finding a nail,
wove it into the lower edge of its web,
so that it should operate as a sinker to
keep the web stretched.</p>

<p>N. G. Johnson, of the Maryland Agricultural
Experiment Station, telling
the Society for the Promotion of Agricultural
Science the story of his fight
with the pea louse, represented that the
pea raisers in his State had lost this
year more than three million dollars by
the ravages of this insect. A parasite
had been discovered which practically
annihilated the pest, but the discovery
was not made in time to save the crops
in some parts of the State from destruction.</p>

<p>The American Society for the Promotion
of Agricultural Science, after
hearing the account of the work of the
Gypsy Moth Commission of Massachusetts,
which has spent more than a million
and a half of dollars in trying to
exterminate the mischievous insect, approved
the action of the Massachusetts
Legislature in maintaining the commission,
and requested that the work be
kept up for a short time longer. This
was because it was represented that the
moth was now confined to a limited
area, and could be easily exterminated
by the expenditure of a small amount
more of money.</p>

<p>The history of science has sustained
a great loss by the burning of most
of the relics which had been collected
for the Volta Centenary Exhibition at
Como, Italy. Only a few things were
saved, comprising a sword presented by
Napoleon Bonaparte to Volta, a cast of
the skull of the great electrician, his
watch, and a few personal relics. On the
other hand, his books and manuscripts,
his collection of batteries, the only authentic
portrait of him, and his will,
were destroyed. Nevertheless, the celebration
was not stopped. The fire was
attributed to the fusing of some electric
wires.</p>

<p>An example of patient industry is
the sorting of hogs’ bristles as it is carried
on at Tientsin, China. Each one of
the hairs of the six hundred thousand
kilogrammes exported from that place
in 1897 had to be picked out, measured,
and placed in the bundle of hairs of corresponding
length; and the different
lengths by which the hairs are sorted
are very numerous.</p>

bites of insects and the infections they
bring by fumigating the entire body
with sulphur. For this purpose he covered
the unclothed body with a suitable
envelope, under which the sulphur was
burned. The remedy was communicated
to M. d’Abbadie by a hippopotamus
hunter who had, by using it, escaped
all the diseases incident to the
swamps to which he had to resort.</p>

<p>A paper has been published by
Pliny T. Sexton, of Palmyra, N. Y., setting
forth reasons for favoring the unification
of the whole educational system
of the State of New York under the
jurisdiction of a single board&mdash;that of
the Regents of the University. The reasons
are presented in the form of various
newspaper articles which were published
last year against a proposition of an opposite
character&mdash;to abolish the present
Department of Public Instruction and
create a State Commission of Education,
the affiliations of which would be political.
Mr. Sexton has further offered two
prizes of one hundred dollars each for
articles or essays by women and similar
productions by men in support of the
proposed unification.</p>

<p>M. Hildebert Richard, of Avignon,
France, relates that he experimented
upon two adult geranium plants,
both healthy and of vigorous growth,
under like conditions of exposure, watering
one (A) with well water and the
other (B) with water containing a
measured proportion of butylic alcohol
daily. A kept on with its healthy
growth. B, after four days of alcoholization,
showed an enfeebled growth,
with symptoms of jaundice, drowsiness,
and intoxication; a special odor perceptible
in all parts of the plant, partially
burned spots, and melanosis and geotropism
in the leaves.</p>

<p>In his papers on The Art and Customs
of Benin, Mr. Ling Roth concludes
that the art of that savage land
consists of mixed elements, partly European
forms which the native mind
was prone to copy, partly introduced
from other parts of Africa. It is characterized
by boldness, freedom, clearness
in execution, originality, and variety.
Among the customs he mentions
are the practice of human sacrifice and
the sprinkling of the blood of the animals
killed at the periodical sacrifices
on the ivories and on the cast-iron or
bronze figure-heads placed on the altars.
When there was too much rain, a woman
had a message saluting the rain god
put into her mouth. She was then
killed and set up in the execution tree,
so that the rain might see.</p>
